do just that with these filters .
once you ’ve selected filters , you can share your narrowed - down list of release notes with anyone .

edition = pe&impact = autouser&cloud%5b%5d = analytics&cloud%5b%5d = chatter&cloud%5b%5d = sales visual enhancements to the html release notes we ’ve made a few changes to the html release notes .
we updated the look - and - feel and added the ability to change the language that you ’re reading in .
updated skin we updated the html release notes to reflect our updated look .
relocated and contextualized the list of release notes we moved the list of release notes from the left side of the screen to the right , so you can focus on the content of the release notes .
because the list of release notes is contained in a smaller box , you always know where in the list you are .
the release note that you ’re currently viewing is always visible ; more often than not , it ’s at the top of the list .
select the language you want to read by default , your browser ’s language settings determine the language we show you in the html release notes .
now you can easily change the language that you ’re viewing the release notes in .
scroll to the footer at the bottom of the page , click change language , and select a language .
before summer ’15 , the only way to view the release notes in a different language was to manually change the language key in the url .
for example , if you were viewing the release notes in german and wanted to view them in english , you ’d change de - de  in the url to en - us .
42 salesforce summer ’15 release notes get more relevant search results get more relevant search results we ’ve improved the way the search engine stores your org ’s information and matches it to your users’ search terms .
the search engine ’s more precise matching rules make it easier for your users to find the information they ’re looking for when they search for terms that include punctuation , such as website addresses and file paths .
editions available in all editions
typically , the search engine ignores certain punctuation symbols from both the search index and the search term used to search .
in most cases , ignoring punctuation symbols returns the most meaningful results , and your users are able to find the information they ’re looking for .
however , in some instances , removing punctuation symbols returns irrelevant results .
the search engine now handles punctuation differently in instances when doing so gives your users more relevant results .
example :  when users search for the following terms , they could find records with these corresponding terms in the results .
search term sku - a1b1 acme.com
sysmail.xml results added a1b1 www.acme.com z:\app / sysmail.xml
sysmailxm results removed skua no results zapp these improvements are available on a rolling basis , after summer ’15 is released , and before the winter ’16 release is rolled out .

currently , menus only support create actions ( see “ create object - specific quick actions ” in the salesforce help ) .
other actions will be supported in future releases .

shorter dataset field names recommended
with summer ’15 plus , we recommend that field names in datasets use no more than 40 characters .
that way , you can reduce the likelihood of exceeding character limits when you augment datasets .
long field names increase the likelihood of exceeding character limits when you augment datasets , because names are appended .
field names longer than 40 characters are currently supported , but we recommend shortening them to avoid issues .
field name character limits may be changed in a future release .

salesforce analytics query language ( generally available ) the salesforce analytics query language , or saql , is now generally available .
to learn more , see the analytics cloud saql reference .
saql enhancements : use more robust syntax use the salesforce analytics query language ( saql ) in wave rest api requests and in dashboard json to return exactly the analytics cloud data that you ’re looking for . 62 salesforce summer ’15 release notes new in summer ` 15 plus important :  this release introduces more robust syntax to prevent errors when executing saql code .
some of these changes may break existing saql code .
update existing code to use the new syntax and rules .
in
this section : maximum number of rows returned per query each query returns a maximum of 10,000 rows by default . min ( ) and max ( ) functions only take measures as arguments if you pass a dimension to a saql min ( )  or max ( )  function , the code throws an error .
ca n’t have same stream on both sides of a cogroup you ca n’t have the same stream on both sides of a cogroup  operation .
if you do , the code throws an error .
ca n’t reference a preprojection id in a postprojection order you ca n’t reference a preprojection id in a postprojection order  operation .
if you do , the code throws an error .
( projection is another term for a foreach  operation . )
ca n’t have two consecutive order statements on the same stream to order a stream by multiple attributes , use a new syntax .
quotation mark rules applied consistently in the previous release , saql handled quotation marks inconsistently for projected labels as input for order , filter , group and alias .
changes to foreach statement the behavior of a foreach  operation ( also called projection ) has changed .
count ( ) function takes grouped source stream as an argument the count ( )  function operates on streams that were inputs to the group  or cogroup  statements .
it does n’t operate on the newly grouped stream or on an ungrouped stream .
saql queries must be compositional saql is compositional — every statement has an input dataset , an operation , and a result dataset , and you can chain statements together to operate on data sequentially .
the order of saql statements is enforced according to how the operations in the statements change the results .
filtering an empty array returns an empty result
when in  operates on an empty array in a filter  operation , everything is filtered and the results are empty .
in the previous release , the operation did n’t filter anything .
explicit stream assignment required you can no longer assign streams to query lines implicitly .
assign streams explicitly .
out of order range filters return false range filters that are out of order ( for example , [ " z " .. " a " ] ) always evaluate to false .
maximum number of rows
returned per query each query returns a maximum of 10,000 rows by default .
to set a different value , use the saql limit statement .
min ( ) and max ( ) functions only take measures as arguments if you pass a dimension to a saql min ( )  or max ( )  function , the code throws an error .
63 salesforce summer ’15 release notes new in summer ` 15 plus important :  this change may break existing saql code .
update existing code to use this new behavior .
the saql in bold is a min ( )  function with a dimension argument .
this statement throws an error . a = load " 0fbxx000000002qcaa/0fcxx000000002wcaq " ; a1 = group a by ( destination ) ; q = foreach a1 generate destination as destination , min(destination ) as mindestination ; limit q 20 ; ca n’t have same stream on both sides of a cogroup you ca n’t have the same stream on both sides of a cogroup  operation .
if you do , the code throws an error .
important :  this change may break existing saql code .
update existing code to use this new behavior .
to perform a cogroup  operation on the same dataset , you can load the dataset into two different streams . a = load " 0fbxx000000002qcaa/0fcxx000000002wcaq " ; b = load " 0fbxx000000002qcaa/0fcxx000000002wcaq " ; b = cogroup a by closeddate , b by createddate ; c = foreach b generate sum(a .
amount ) as amount ; you can also filter the dataset into two different streams : a = load " 0fbxx000000002qcaa/0fcxx000000002wcaq " ; a = filter a by " region " in [ " west " ] ; a = filter a by " status " in [ " closed " ] ; b = filter a by " year " in [ 2014 ] ; c = filter a by " year " in [ 2015 ] ; d = cogroup b by ( " state " ) , c by ( " state " ) ; d = foreach d generate " state " as " state " , sum(b .
amount ) as " amount_2014 " , sum(c .
amount ) as " amount_2015 " ; this code throws an error because it performs a cogroup operation on a single stream , a : a = load " 0fbxx000000002qcaa/0fcxx000000002wcaq " ; b = cogroup a by closeddate , a by createddate ; c = foreach b generate sum(a . amount ) as amount ; ca n’t reference a preprojection id in a postprojection order you ca n’t reference a preprojection id in a postprojection order  operation .
if you do , the code throws an error .
( projection is another term for a foreach  operation . )

important :  this change may break existing saql code .
update existing code to use this new behavior .
unique names required in a projection using a name multiple times in a projection throws an error .
in the previous release , this query produced only the last projected alias in the result set .
in this release , the last line is invalid and throws an error : l = load " 0fbxx000000002qcaa/0fcxx000000002wcaq " ; r = load " 0fbyy000000002qcaa/0fcyy000000002wcaq " ; l = foreach

a foreach  operation returns rows based on filtered dataset size .
for example , this query returns all the rows in the loaded dataset : q = load " 0fbxx000000002qcaa/0fcxx000000002wcaq " ; q = foreach q generate 1 as num ; in the previous release , it returned one row .
66 salesforce summer ’15 release notes new in summer ` 15 plus count ( ) function takes grouped source stream as an argument the count ( )  function operates on streams that were inputs to the group  or cogroup  statements .
it does n’t operate on the newly grouped stream or on an ungrouped stream .
important :  this change may break existing saql code .
update existing code to use this new behavior .
the count ( )  function operates on the stream a  that group  operated on : a = load " 0fbxx000000002qcaa/0fcxx000000002wcaq " ; a1 = group a by ( year ) ; q = foreach a1 generate count(a ) as countyear , count ( ) as count , year as year ; q = limit q 20 ; note :  the source stream argument can be grouped or cogrouped .
in the previous release , you could also pass a1  to count ( ) , but this example now throws an error : a = load " 0fbxx000000002qcaa/0fcxx000000002wcaq " ; a1 = group a by ( year ) ; q = foreach a1 generate count(a1 ) as countyear , count ( ) as count , year as year ; q = limit q 20 ; tip :  you can still use count ( )  with no arguments on ungrouped data .
saql queries must be compositional saql is compositional — every statement has an input dataset , an operation , and a result dataset , and you can chain statements together to operate on data sequentially .
the order of saql statements is enforced according to how the operations in the statements change the results .
important :  this change may break existing saql code .
update existing code to use this new behavior .
the statement order rules are : • the order of filter  and order  can be swapped because it does n’t change the results . •
offset  must follow filter  and order • offset  must come before limit • there can be no more than 1 offset  statement after a foreach  statement . filtering an empty array returns an empty result when in  operates on an empty array in a filter  operation , everything is filtered and the results are empty .
in the previous release , the operation did n’t filter anything .

important :  this change may break existing saql code .
update existing code to use this new behavior .
in the previous release , if the query had range filters in reverse order , the results were calculated by reversing the parameters .
in this release , the parameters are not reversed .
for example , this query used to return dates in range [ " 20 years ago " .. " 2016 - 01 - 11 " ] .

augment transformation offers more support for multiple matches control the augment transformation ’s behavior in a new way when it encounters multiple matches .
previously , analytics cloud returned results from all matched rows .
now , the augment transformation can return results from one of the matched rows — which is the new default behavior — or from all matched rows .
for each record in the left dataset , the augment transformation performs a lookup to find a matching record in the right dataset .
if the left dataset has a one - to - many relationship with the right dataset , analytics cloud might find multiple matches for a left record .
how analytics cloud handles multiple matches depends on the specified augment operation .
you can specify the lookupsinglevalue or lookupmultivalue  operation in the augment transformation .
if you do n’t specify an operation , analytics cloud treats the augment as if you specified the lookupsinglevalue operation .
note :  the default behavior changes in this release .
analytics cloud might produce different results based on the new default behavior .
to revert back to the default behavior of the previous release , set the operation to lookupmultivalue .
lookupsinglevalue operation use the lookupsinglevalue  operation to force the augment transformation to return results from a single row when multiple matches are found .
analytics cloud randomly selects one row from the list of matched rows .
note :  each time you run the dataflow , analytics cloud can return a different result depending on the returned row .
for example , you apply the augment transformation on the following datasets , set the relationship to " price , " and match them based on the i d  and prodid  fields . 75 salesforce summer ’15 release notes integrate data : preview metadata and delete datasets
although there are multiple rows for prod3 , analytics cloud randomly chooses one matching row and returns values based on that row .
here ’s the resulting dataset after the augment if analytics cloud chooses the first prod3 row .
lookupmultivalue operation use the lookupmultivalue  operation to force the augment transformation to return results from all matching rows when multiple matches are found .
when multiple matches are found , analytics cloud creates multiple dimension values and sums measure values in the resulting dataset record .
for example , you apply the augment transformation on the following datasets , set the relationship to " price , " and match them based on the i d  and prodid  fields . because the lookup returns multiple rows for prod3 , the price .
pricebook field in the resulting dataset appears twice , once for each match .
the measure field price .
unitprice  contains 1500 , which is the sum of 800 and 700 .
here ’s the resulting dataset after the augment .
operation example you specify the operation in the augment transformation as shown in the following dataflow snippet
. " augment_opportunitieswithaccountdetails " : { " action " : " augment " , " parameters " : { " operation " : " lookupsinglevalue " , " left " : " extract_opportunity " , " left_key " : [ " accountid " ] , " relationship " : " opptyacct " , " right " : " extract_accountdetails " , " right_key " : [ " i d " ] , " right_select " : [ " name " , 76 salesforce summer ’15 release notes " billingaddress " ] } } explore data : group and filter dimensions , measures , and fiscal periods explore data : group and filter dimensions , measures , and fiscal periods quickly focus your visualizations with the new filter operators for dimensions , measures , and fiscal periods .

and it ’s also available in the salesforce1 mobile browser app . editions flows are available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions a flow is an application that can execute logic , interact with the salesforce database , call apex classes , and collect data from users .
you can build flows by using the cloud flow designer .
for example , a flow can step support representatives through a call script that provides different questions based on selections that the user makes earlier in the call .
this way , the support representative does n’t try to sell a product to the customer when she already has the product .
a flow interview is a running instance of a flow .
to view a paused interview in salesforce1 , select paused flow interviews from the navigation menu .
a list displays the flow interviews that the current user paused .
the user can tap a specific interview to view details and then tap resume or delete .
any valid values that users entered before they paused are saved with the interview , so they do n't have to reenter that information when they resume .
the paused flow interviews item is included in the salesforce1 navigation menu by default .
you can customize where this item appears in the navigation menu .
from setup in the full salesforce site , click salesforce1 setup > mobile navigation .
receive notifications about posts to groups mobile users can learn about new posts in groups they ’re members of — even if they are n’t specifically mentioned — with a new notification type .
these alerts are available as in - app notifications for all versions of salesforce1 and also as push notifications in version 7.3 of the salesforce1 downloadable apps .
mentions and new comments in group feeds do n’t trigger notifications .
group notifications indicate the name of the colleague who posted and the group posted to .
if multiple people post to a group in the same day , each new notification reflects the total number of posts so far .
to make group notifications available to your users , salesforce1 in - app and push notifications must be turned on .
from setup in the full salesforce site , click salesforce1 setup > notification options .
editions groups available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions users enable group notifications for themselves from the full salesforce site by selecting the email every post option on each desired group ’s page .
this option now turns on the salesforce1 group notification type in addition to standard email notifications .
if users find group post push notifications too distracting , they can easily opt out while continuing to see in - app notifications about these activities in the notifications list .
in the salesforce1 navigation menu , tap settings > push notification settings then turn off posts to a group note :  group notifications are n’t supported in communities .

other salesforce1 setup and rollout enhancements salesforce adoption manager available in more regions salesforce adoption manager is now available for organizations based in the u.k. and australia , as well as those in the united states . 97 salesforce summer ’15 release notes salesforce1 obsolete publisher icon field removed from salesforce1 branding pages
the publisher icon  field has been removed from the salesforce1 branding pages , which are accessible in setup by clicking salesforce1 setup > branding .
the publisher icon was removed from the salesforce1 mobile browser app in winter ’15 and from the downloadable apps starting with version 7.0 . because earlier versions of the downloadable apps are no longer supported , the publisher icon  field is now obsolete .

access external data with lightning connect with lightning connect , users of the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios and the salesforce1 mobile browser app can view and search data that 's stored outside your organization .
lightning connect accesses the external data in real time via web service callouts and represents the data in salesforce external objects .
( lightning connect is available in developer edition and for an extra cost , in enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions . )
previously , you could access only open data protocol – exposed data on external systems .

for more information , see lightning connect on page 219 .
other navigation and actions enhancements scroll more easily and with better context when viewing long lists ( tablets
only )
when using the salesforce1 mobile browser app on a tablet , it 's easier to work with the information displayed on object home pages and in listviews and search results .
users can scroll seamlessly through long lists of records instead of using navigation buttons to switch between multiple pages .
and column headings remain at the top of the page when scrolling , so users can always identify the categories of data they ’re looking at .
open most salesforce urls directly in a salesforce1 downloadable app the salesforce1 downloadable app for android , version 7.2 now supports url schemes , same as the salesforce1 for ios app .
when a user taps a salesforce url hyperlink , or enters a salesforce url into a browser address bar on a mobile device , she ’s taken directly to that page in salesforce1 .
this saves users from having to manually navigate to desired information in the app .
for example , a user can email a salesforce url for an account to some coworkers .
simply by tapping the link in the email , a coworker using a salesforce1 downloadable app can automatically open the account record in the app .
an administrator or developer can customize a url scheme to perform a specific action when salesforce1 launches . see salesforce1 mobile url schemes for more information .
page scrolling for assistive technology users has changed to buttons for assistive technology users , scrolling in the salesforce1 for ios downloadable app is now done with buttons instead of three - finger swiping .
buttons are located at the top and bottom of the page for vertical scrolling and on the left and right for horizontal scrolling 98 salesforce summer ’15 release notes salesforce1 regions .
we 've replaced three - finger scrolling with scrolling buttons to improve performance and to provide users with a consistent scrolling experience throughout the app .
call or log action renamed productivity action is now named call .
we made this change to clarify the primary use of the action and to the call or log differentiate it from the log a call quick action .
the functionality of the call action hasn't changed— it 's still possible to use call to log a note on a record without making a phone call first .
but it 's usually faster to use the log a call action for this sort of activity .
this change is available in the salesforce1 mobile browser app and in version 7.0 or later of the downloadable apps .
google map images replace the map productivity action with a map now appearing in standard address fields , users can see account or contact locations directly on record detail pages .
( for a map to display , an address must include the street , city , and either the state , postal code , or country . )
the google maps image feature that was released in spring ’15 is replacing the map productivity action .
with a map image now appearing in standard address fields , users can see account or contact locations directly on record detail pages .
( for a map to display , an address must include the street , city , and either the state , postal code , or country . )
tapping a map image opens the address in a map app , where users can see more details or get directions .
see “ maps and location services ” in the salesforce help for more information .
the old action is no longer included in the salesforce1 action bar on accounts , contacts , or person accounts .
account news replaces the read news productivity action the account news feature that was released in spring ’15 is replacing the read news productivity action .

swipe to the end of the search scope bar and tap feeds . ) to find posts in the “
all company ”
chatter searching the feed with global search is a little different than searching other objects .
the search page does n’t show a list of recently viewed posts , the app does n’t start looking for matching posts while a user is typing keywords in the search box , and the action bar does n’t display at the bottom of the search results page .
other sales productivity enhancements key fields automatically update when changing an opportunity 's stage updating the sales stage , either in the opportunity record or the sales path , automatically updates the forecast category and probability % .
previously , users needed to manually refresh the page for these fields to update .
this enhancement is available in all salesforce1 apps .

( salesforce knowledge is available in performance and developer editions , and for an additional cost in enterprise and unlimited editions . )
other chatter enhancements dismiss recommendations in feeds salesforce1 mobile browser app users can now dismiss recommendations so they no longer appear in feeds , including community feeds .

focus on useful information in group list views to help mobile users focus on the most relevant information , salesforce1 no longer clutters up group list views with the date and time of the last activity on the feed .
and the archived status field is no longer displayed —
previously this information was included in group list views when accessed on a tablet .
( groups are available in professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions . )

100 salesforce summer ’15 release notes salesforce1 create custom recommendations in community feeds from a different location in community management drive engagement with your mobile community users by adding custom recommendations to community feeds .
custom recommendations are supported in the salesforce1 mobile browser app for any community using the salesforce tabs + visualforce template .
you now create custom recommendations for communities from a different location in community management , by clicking recommendations > recommendations .
to clarify some misinformation in the salesforce spring ’15 release notes , communities using the napili template do not support custom recommendations in the salesforce1 mobile browser app .
we do n’t recommend using salesforce1 to access communities that use napili or any other community builder template because these communities contain rich styling that does n’t display in the mobile app .
see “
access to communities using salesforce1 ” in the salesforce help for more information .
other offline enhancements see improved visual feedback during page loading
all salesforce1 users now experience a smoother transition while pages are loading .

if you previously relaxed ip restrictions for any of the downloadable apps then decide to turn on the enforce login ip ranges on every request  option , user access to the mobile apps may change .
see continuously enforce ip addresses in login ip ranges on page 314 for more information about this new setting .
and see connected app ip relaxation and continuous ip enforcement to learn how connected app ip relaxation settings interact with continuous ip enforcement .

related lists on accounts and contacts are empty when the name  field is encrypted .
• file encryption indicators do n’t display in the app .
• records cloned by users who do n’t have the “ view encrypted data ” permission include masked data for encrypted fields .
other miscellaneous enhancements experience faster app loading we ’ve improved performance of the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios , version 7.3 by changing how the app looks and behaves when it ’s loading .
•
when logging in to salesforce1 for ios the first time , the user now sees a gray splash screen with a blue header until custom or default branding resources , such as logo and background color , finish downloading .
it ’s possible this login session may complete 101 salesforce summer ’15 release notes salesforce1 before there ’s time to display any branding .
when the app loads on subsequent logins , the user sees a branded splash screen — which includes any custom branding applied to the app by your organization . see “
custom branding for the salesforce1 mobile app ” in the salesforce help .. •
whenever the user backgrounds or foregrounds the app , your organization ’s custom - branded splash screen displays , as before .
but for organizations using the default salesforce1 branding , the app simply blurs the screen during backgrounding and foregrounding .
salesforce1 differences from the full salesforce site the salesforce1 app does n’t have all of the functionality of the full salesforce site , and in some cases includes features that are n’t available in the full site .
for features introduced or updated in summer ’15 , these areas have differences : supported salesforce data salesforce1 users ca n’t add products with revenue or quantity schedules to opportunities .
if this is attempted , the product appears on the opportunity , but the schedule is n’t created .
users also ca n’t reestablish a product schedule from an opportunity .

in
this section : report management for partner and customer users —
create and edit reports community partner and customer users can now create and edit reports in their own personal folder or in a privately shared folder if they have sufficient permissions .
you can grant partner and customer users permissions to create and edit reports through their profiles or by using permission sets .
after you grant the required permissions , they can use the drag - and - drop report builder tool .

report management for partner and customer users —
create and edit reports community partner and customer users can now create and edit reports in their own personal folder or in a privately shared folder if they have sufficient permissions .
you can grant partner and customer users permissions to create and edit reports through their profiles or by using permission sets .
after you grant the required permissions , they can use the drag - and - drop report builder tool .
to allow partner and customer users to create and edit reports , turn on the “ create and customize reports , ” “ report builder , ” and “ edit my reports ” permissions through custom profiles or permission sets .
these permissions were added to the following external user licenses that already have the “
run reports ” permission : • customer community plus • customer community plus login • partner community 118 salesforce summer ’15 release notes community reporting • partner community login • gold partner • silver partner • customer portal manager • customer portal manager custom note :  permissions to create and edit reports are n’t available for high - volume licenses , such as customer community or high volume customer portal .
considerations and limitations •
if your organization existed before the summer ’13 release , you must first turn on enhanced sharing for reports and dashboards before granting role - based users permissions .
see analytics folder sharing . •
data visibility is based on two main things : the account role the partner or customer belongs to and your organization ’s sharing rules .
your organization ’s field - level security is respected meaning that if a field is not visible for external users , a partner or customer user wo n’t see it in report builder . •
if you want your external users to create or edit reports in a privately shared folder , grant them “
viewer ” access on the folder . •
if you want your external users to export report data , grant them the “
export reports ” permission .
• external users ca n’t create , edit , or view reports in the unfiled public reports folder .
•
depending on what objects , fields , and categories your external users have access to , they might see custom report types in the ui when creating a new report .
custom report types are visible if a user has read access on any fields or objects included in the custom report type .

this custom report type allows you to report on feed activity for all standard objects that have feed tracking enabled , such as accounts , cases , leads , opportunities , and custom objects .
you ’ll also be able to track the number of feed 119 salesforce summer ’15 release notes other changes in communities edits and see what type of users are editing feeds .
this package provides an account feeds dashboard that you can use as an example to create your own customized dashboards .
filter
by user detail the network members custom report type gives you access to the following lookup fields : lastlogindate , department , country , role , and profile .
these lookup fields can help you gain deeper insights into your data .
to display these additional fields in your reports , edit the custom report type layout and click add fields related via lookup .
with access to user detail , you could re - purpose member reports to report on other things such as accounts .
for example , you can make a copy of a member report and then add the user .
account  field through the network members lookup fields .
this approach allows you to take the top 10 members by contribution report to create a new report called top 10 accounts by contributor report .

note :  record visibility in communities depends on user licenses , profiles , and sharing access .
when a record is added to a group , everyone in the group with the necessary access can see it , but chatter free users do n’t see any records .
this feature is enabled by default for all organizations , but some additional setup is required : • include the add record action in the group publisher layout to allow users to add records . •

this change enhances search results with more topic - related urls , particularly for topics related to articles .
users get complete and targeted search results when searching for specific content .
each community has a unique association with a robots.txt file that ’s shared by all communities .

now the urls that are generated along with emails dynamically route users to the source of the email .
a community user simply clicks a link in the email message to view the referenced content .
this redirection works with all community templates .
users are routed to community content as expected even if you change a community ’s template .
note :  emails generated from communities based on the aloha template direct users to the organization ’s aloha portal .
enable case and lead assignment rules more intuitively
the options available for the case assignment checkbox and lead assignment checkbox now respect both the default setting and the show on edit page  checkbox independently .

to update the case assignment checkbox , edit the layout properties of the case page layout .
example :  to force case assignment rules , select default  under case assignment checkbox .
this means end users wo n’t see any option to turn off case assignment when editing a case .
you can also decide to include the assign using active assignment rules checkbox by selecting show on edit page .
if you select both options , the assignment checkbox is displayed and is checked by default .
the default setting will force the assignment rule to run unless you also display the checkbox and a user manually deselects the checkbox .

this section : assign territories to opportunities more efficiently ( generally available ) filter - based opportunity territory assignment lets you use a simple job to assign territories to opportunities .
we provide code for an apex class that you can use as - is or modify as needed based on our guidelines .
after you create and deploy the class , run the job to complete the assignment process .
job options include making assignments within date ranges and assigning territories to open opportunities only .
you can also configure your settings to run the job every time an opportunity is created .
assign any territory to an opportunity
now your organization can assign any territory within the active territory model to an opportunity — either manually , from the opportunity record ; automatically , using filter - based opportunity territory assignment ; or programmatically , via the api .
your organization is no longer restricted to assigning only a territory that is also assigned to the opportunity ’s account .
manual assignments made by users are controlled by users’ sharing access to the opportunity ’s assigned ( parent ) account .
use chatter to collaborate on territory models if your organization uses chatter , your team can now use it to collaborate on territory model development .
associate assignment rules to territories more efficiently
now it ’s easier to choose the assignment rules you want to assign to territories .
on the page where you assign rules , hover over a rule name to view its criteria .
buttons and links now available for territory model and territory pages give your team easy access to territory - related features , tools , and data within salesforce by defining buttons and links and adding them to territory model and territory page layouts .
integrate territory id information from external systems store , search for , and report on territory ids you maintain in external systems .
assign territories to opportunities more efficiently ( generally available ) filter - based opportunity territory assignment lets you use a simple job to assign territories to opportunities .
we provide code for an apex class that you can use as - is or modify as needed based on our guidelines .
after you create and deploy the class , run the job to complete the assignment process .
job options include making assignments within date ranges and assigning territories to open opportunities only .
you can also configure your settings to run the job every time an opportunity is created .
opportunity territory assignment is enabled for qualified organizations by default .
the apex class code salesforce provides assigns territories to opportunities based on a number of factors . •
is the opportunity excluded from filter - based territory assignment ?
if so , no territory is assigned .
• does the opportunity have an account assigned and does that account have a territory assigned from the active territory model ?
if so , the account ’s territory is assigned to the opportunity .
if not , no territory is assigned .
• does the opportunity ’s assigned account have multiple territories from the active model assigned ?
if so , the job can use a priority value from the territory2type object or other criteria to determine which territory ( if any ) to assign to the opportunity .
for complete instructions on setting up and deploying filter - based opportunity territory assignment , see enterprise territory management implementation guide .
for details about the apex class you need to create and deploy , see new and changed apex classes on page 260 .
130 salesforce summer ’15 release notes enterprise territory management assign
any territory to an opportunity now your organization can assign any territory within the active territory model to an opportunity — either manually , from the opportunity record ; automatically , using filter - based opportunity territory assignment ; or programmatically , via the api .
your organization is no longer restricted to assigning only a territory that is also assigned to the opportunity ’s account .
manual assignments made by users are controlled by users’ sharing access to the opportunity ’s assigned ( parent ) account .
when a territory is assigned to an opportunity , that opportunity is shared with all salesforce users assigned to that territory 's parent in the territory model hierarchy .
for manual territory assignment ( from the territory  field on the opportunity record ) , territory assignment is based on a user ’s sharing access for the opportunity ’s account .
users who have sharing access to that account can assign any active territory to the opportunity .
users who do not can assign only a territory that is also assigned to the opportunity ’s account .
for manual territory assignments , salesforce still suggests opportunities assigned to the territory ’s account .
users with sharing access can search for and assign any territory in the active territory model .
example :  utel.com has six opportunities and two territories ( east coast and west coast ) .
they can assign east coast , west coast , or any other territory within the active model to any or all of those six opportunities .
one of their sales reps has sharing access to the account assigned to one of the opportunities , so she can assign any territory to that opportunity .
for the other five opportunities , she does not have sharing access to assigned accounts .
so for each of those opportunities , she can only assign a territory that is already assigned to the opportunity ’s assigned account .
use chatter to collaborate on territory models if your organization uses chatter , your team can now use it to collaborate on territory model development .
after you enable and configure chatter feed tracking , anyone with access to a territory model record can use chatter to collaborate on that model .
those who follow the record will get notifications in their own chatter feeds when model states change and tracked fields 131 salesforce summer ’15 release notes enterprise territory management are updated .
make sure to tell others who maintain territory models that they can now use chatter to follow and collaborate on territory models directly from model records .
for details on enabling the chatter feed for the territory model object , see the enterprise territory management implementation guide .
associate assignment rules to territories more efficiently
now it ’s easier to choose the assignment rules you want to assign to territories .
on the page where you assign rules , hover over a rule name to view its criteria .
buttons and links now available for territory model and territory pages give your team easy access to territory - related features , tools , and data within salesforce by defining buttons and links and adding them to territory model and territory page layouts .
for more information about working with buttons and links — including more examples — see “ actions , buttons , and links overview ” in the salesforce help .
when you create a button or link , make sure to add it to your territory model or territory page layouts , as appropriate .
let your users know it ’s there and how to use it .
132 salesforce summer ’15 release notes collaborative forecasts example :  utel.com ’s active territory model includes geo - based , named account , and overlay territories .
they have a custom report that shows territories that have assigned accounts , grouped by account object ’s billing zip / postal code  field .
their administrator creates a custom link to that report and adds the link to the territory page layout .
now , those who manage or administer territories can quickly access the report and get a list of all territories within a zip code , regardless of territory dimension .
integrate territory id information from external systems store , search for , and report on territory ids you maintain in external systems .
enterprise territory management now supports the externalid type of custom field on the territory2 object .
this means you can create a custom field that appears on territory records and use that field to store external ids . query and report on that field within salesforce .
for details on creating custom fields , see “ create custom fields ” and “ custom field attributes ” in the salesforce help .
make sure to add your custom field to territory record page layouts , and let your team know how to use it .
example :  for territory modeling purposes , utel.com maintains some of their territory data in an external system .
they create a custom external id field to map and track that data within their salesforce territory records .
see also : ideaexchange : external id on the territory object collaborative forecasts predict and plan the sales cycle from pipeline to closed sales , and manage sales expectations throughout the organization with collaborative forecasts .
give sales teams a clearer view of their outlook with cumulative forecast rollups on the forecasts tab , cumulative forecast rollup amounts combine the rollups of opportunities from multiple forecast categories .
these rollups give users a clearer view of their total monthly or quarterly sales numbers .
editions enterprise available in : • professional • • performance • unlimited • developer
now , you can choose between two methods of rolling up opportunities into forecasts for your sales teams . •
the original method , which rolls up the opportunities from each individual forecast category into separate forecast amounts for each category . •
the new method , which rolls up opportunities from more than one forecast category into cumulative forecast amounts .
133 salesforce summer ’15 release notes collaborative forecasts when you choose cumulative forecast rollups in setup , the way opportunities roll up to forecast amounts changes , along with the names of the columns on the forecasts tab .
see the differences for yourself .
category rollup method column name in the forecasts tab opportunities that roll up to it individual pipeline best case commit closed cumulative open pipeline best case forecast commit forecast closed only pipeline best case commit closed • pipeline • best case • commit • best case • commit • closed • commit • closed closed advantages of cumulative forecast rollups with individual forecast category rollups , each total and subtotal represents opportunities from only one of the individual forecast categories .
this type of rollup means that if forecast users want to know the total that they ’re going to actually bring for the month or quarter , they need to add the best case , commit , and closed forecast amounts together themselves .
example : individual forecast rollup forecast amounts closed opportunities $ 50 closed $ 50 commit $ 100 commit • $ 50 • $ 50 best case $ 150 best case • $ 50 • $ 50 • $ 50 pipeline $ 200 pipeline • $ 50 • $ 50 • $ 50 • $ 50 with cumulative forecast rollups , the forecast columns show cumulative amounts from the opportunities in the named forecast category , as well as subsequent categories in your sales funnel .
this view makes it easier for sales teams to see the total numbers they ’re likely to bring in , saving them from combining the category totals themselves .
134 salesforce summer ’15 release notes collaborative forecasts
for example , this table shows the cumulative forecast rollup amounts when there are four pipeline , three best case , two commit , and one closed opportunity , each worth $ 50 .
example : cumulative forecast rollup forecast amounts closed only commit forecast best case forecast open pipeline opportunities $ 50 closed $ 50 $ 150 commit • $ 50 • $ 50 $ 300 best case • $ 50 • $ 50 • $ 50 $ 450 pipeline • $ 50 • $ 50 • $ 50 • $ 50 note :  forecast historical trending ca n’t be used in organizations that use cumulative forecast rollups .
enable cumulative forecast rollups for sales reps and managers your organization can use either cumulative forecast rollup columns or individual forecast category columns .
be aware that changing the forecast column display purges all adjustments to commit and best case forecast amounts , but not quota data . 1 .

for complete details about the forecastingitemcategory  field , see api changes for cumulative forecast rollups .
api changes for cumulative forecast rollups understand which type of forecast rollup each of your forecast amounts and adjustments belong to when you use the api .
api beginning with api version 34.0 , the forecastingitem , forecastingadjustment , and forecastingowneradjustment objects each include a new field : forecastingitemcategory .
this field indicates which type of forecast rollup the forecasting item or adjustment belongs to .
with the addition of the cumulative forecast rollups feature , you have these possible values for the forecastingitemcategory  field .

the forecastingitemcategory  field differs from the existing forecastcategoryname  field . •
the forecastcategoryname  field represents the forecast category of the underlying opportunities rolling up to forecast amounts .
in organizations using cumulative forecast rollups , the forecastcategoryname  field can be null because the cumulative forecast amounts include opportunities from multiple forecast categories . •
the new forecastingitemcategory  field represents the type of rollup a forecast amount or adjustment is from .
in organizations using individual forecast category columns , it contains the individual forecast rollup categories .
in organizations using cumulative forecast rollups , it contains the cumulative rollup categories .
when inserting manager or owner adjustments , the values you insert for forecastcategoryname  and forecastingitemcategory  must be compatible with each other .
in organizations using cumulative forecast rollups , the forecastcategoryname  is nullable .

with omni - channel , you can set the priority of work items to make sure that critical assignments get taken care of quickly .
you can manage your agents’ capacity and availability for work to ensure that they ’re given only the number of assignments that they can handle .

create a bulk macro a bulk macro is a macro that you can run on multiple records at the same time .
only macros that meet certain criteria can be run as bulk macros .
bulk macros are supported for the : • email publisher in case feed on the salesforce console for service •
all quick actions except for social quick actions editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions with a service cloud license bulk macros are not supported for : • salesforce knowlege actions • community actions • social post actions • “ add ” and “ insert ” instructions ( such as the add to subject instruction or the insert into html body instruction for the email publisher ) if the bulk macro interacts with the email publisher , it can contain only one email publisher action .
a bulk macro must contain at least one submit action instruction .
example :  suppose that your company has a service outage and lots of customers have contacted customer support .
you want support agents to send an email to customers who have opened cases about the outage telling them when the service outage will end .
you can create a bulk macro that uses an email template to create and send an email to these customers .
see “
create a bulk macro ” in the salesforce help for steps on how to recreate this example in your organization .
run bulk macros on multiple records at the same time
previously , a support agent could run a macro only on one record at a time .
now , agents can run a bulk macro on multiple records at the same time .
bulk macros let agents easily address spikes in customer cases involving the same issue .
user permissions needed to view macros : “ read ” on macros to create and edit macros : “ create ” and “ edit ” on macros to create and run irreversible macros : “ manage macros that users ca n’t undo ”
to run bulk macros : “ run macros on multiple records ”
editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions with a service cloud license you can run bulk macros records from the accounts , cases , contacts , and leads objects .
however , you can run a bulk macro only on records in one object list view at a time .
for example , you can run a bulk macro on multiple cases in the cases list view , but not on cases and accounts at the same time .
an icon showing a green lightning bolt with two underlines ( ) indicates whether a macro is a bulk macro .
167 salesforce summer ’15 release notes macros increase efficiency bulk macros are processed in increments of 10 macros at a time .
you can run a bulk macro on more than 10 cases , but the system processes the macro in groups of 10 at a time . 1 . 2 . 3 .
in the case list view , select the cases that you want to run the macro on .
you can filter the cases to identify which cases you want to run the macro on .
in the macro widget , select the macro and click run .
in the confirmation window , click ok to continue .
the macro runs on the selected cases .
in the list view , the cases on which the macro ran successfully are highlighted in green and denoted by a green check mark icon .
cases that the macro did n’t run successfully on are highlighted in red and denoted by a red x icon .
to see an explanation about why the macro did n’t work on a case , hover over the red x icon .
example :  suppose that there ’s an increase in customer cases about the same issue .
you can use a macro to email these customers , assuring them that your company is aware of the issue and is working to fix it .
select the cases that you want to apply the macro to .
in each case , the macro applies an email template to a new email , addresses the email to case contact , and sends the email .
quickly search salesforce knowledge and attach articles to cases using macros
in the summer  15 release , you can create macros to automatically run keyword searches for salesforce knowledge articles and attach articles to cases .
using macros makes it easier and faster for support agents to find and provide relevant support articles about common customer issues .
editions salesforce knowledge must be set up before you can use macros to search and attach articles .
now support agents can use macros to : • search for salesforce knowledge articles by keyword and by article number • attach the most relevant article to the case • attach an article as a pdf or as html to an email in case feed • insert an article into a case as html available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions with a service cloud license and with a salesforce knowledge example :  you can create and run a macro to automatically select an article and attach it to a reply email to a customer .
for example , suppose customers often contact support for information about resetting their passwords . you can create a macro that selects the “
how to reset your password ” article and inserts it into the support agent ’s reply email .
this macro saves the agent time spent searching for articles and copying and pasting them into emails .
post to social networks using macros you now can create and run macros to automatically post to social networks such as twitter or facebook .
social customer service must be set up before you can use macros to post to social networks .
example :  you can create a macro to insert quick text into a social post .
in social post actions , the “ insert ” instruction is useful because you can retain the @mention and add text after it .

the macro replaces the field with an empty string when no value is specified .
example :  you can use a macro to provide a standardized email response to a customer .
you can create and run a macro that replaces the subject field and the email body in an email feed item .
the macro clears any existing values in an email feed item , and replaces them with the specified subject and text .
insert field values into a case using macros you can use macros to automatically insert field values into fields , making it simple to add additional information to a record .
add  and insert instructions tell the macro to add the specified field values to the existing values in a field .
add and insert instructions append the specified value or text to the field , but do not delete any values or text already in the field .
when a macro runs an add or insert instruction on a single - line field , the new value is appended to the existing values .
when the field is a multi - line field , such as an email body field , the macro inserts the specified value at the cursor position in the field .
editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions with a service cloud license editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions with a service cloud license example :  you can create a macro to insert quick text into a community post .
in community actions , the “

new user permission for creating and running macros that users ca n’t undo some macros perform actions that ca n’t be undone , such as sending outbound emails to customers or updating a case status .
previously , any administrator or support agent with the create macros  permission could create and run macros that performed irreversible actions .
now , administrators and agents must have the manage macros users ca n’t undo  user permission to create , edit , and run macros that contain instructions for performing irreversible actions .
the manage macros users ca n’t undo  user permission controls whether users ( including administrators ) can create , edit , and run macros that contain instructions that perform irreversible actions .
administrators and agents without this permission can still share , clone , or delete macros that contain such instructions , as long as they have the required permissions for these actions .
administrators and agents without this permission can still create and edit macros that do n’t contain instructions for performing irreversible actions , provided they have the required permissions for creating and editing .
available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions with a service cloud license editions to enable this user permission , from setup , click administer > manage users > permission sets .
under app permissions > call center section , select manage macros users ca n’t undo . 169 salesforce summer ’15 release notes enable case assignment rules more intuitively enhancements to searching for macros
previously , the macros search list only displayed a maximum of 400 macros .
this limitation has been removed in summer  15 .
we changed the search from client - side to server - side in order to remove the 400-macro display limit .
as a result , searches can take longer because they are running on the server .
for best performance , the maximum number of macros that a user can access is 5,000 macros .

right now , it ’s 4:30 pm and the support agent has a milestone due at 11:00 am the next day .
in this case , the milestone tracker shows the remaining time in business hours , so the remaining time is 2.5 hours .
( 4:30 - 5:00 pm today and 9:00 - 11:00 am tomorrow . )
if the remaining time is shown in actual hours : however , if you set the milestone tracker to show time in actual hours , the milestone tracker ignores the business hours .
instead , the milestone tracker shows the remaining time using the full amount of time between the present time and when the milestone is due .
so , if it ’s 4:30 pm now and the milestone is due at 11:00 am tomorrow , the remaining time would be 18.5 hours .

177 salesforce summer ’15 release notes live agent enabling omni - channel with your existing live agent implementation
so you ’ve decided to take your customer service to the next level with live agent .
that ’s great !
if you ’re already supporting your customers with live agent chat , there are a few things you need to know before you start managing chat traffic with live agent in omni - channel
. editions as you know , live agent is powered by live agent configurations , which control the behaviors and settings that are available to live agent users .
similarly , omni - channel uses presence configurations to control the behaviors and settings that are available to omni - channel users .
you can integrate live agent with omni - channel .
that way , chats are routed just like other work items , and your agents are able to accept or reject chat requests from the omni - channel widget .
in that case , your live agent users also become omni - channel users , so your chat agents need to be associated with both a live agent configuration and a presence configuration .
luckily , salesforce does some of the heavy lifting for you when you enable omni - channel with your current live agent implementation .
for each live agent configuration that you already have in your organization , salesforce creates a corresponding presence configuration for you .
if you have multiple live agent configurations in place , salesforce creates a different presence configuration for each live agent configuration .
let ’s say you already have live agent enabled , and you have 20 agents who handle chats .
these agents are assigned to a live agent configuration .
omni - channel is available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions editions live agent is available in : performance editions and developer edition organizations that were created after june 14 , 2012 live agent is available for an additional cost in : enterprise and unlimited editions when you enable omni - channel , salesforce creates a new presence configuration for you that corresponds to your live agent configuration .
salesforce automatically assigns all 20 of your chat agents to the new presence configuration .
that way , there ’s no disruption to your agents’ workflow when you enable omni - channel , and they can start accepting chats through the omni - channel widget in the console right away . 178 salesforce summer ’15 release notes salesforce console for service salesforce console for service the salesforce console for service is an app that ’s designed for users in fast - paced environments who need to find , update , and create records quickly to support their customers .

the community case feed gives community users an intuitive , versatile environment where they can manage their cases .
using the publisher ( 1 ) , users create posts and attach files to the case .
the feed ( 2 ) comes fully equipped with chatter ’s collaboration tools : users can bookmark , like , and comment on posts , and mention other users .
images and comments appear inline , making it easy to scan the feed for details .
the attachments sidebar ( 3 ) displays all case attachments . 183 salesforce summer ’15 release notes service communities

if the salesforce administrator exposes read - only social posts on cases , these also appear in the community case feed .
the community case feed is available in all communities built on the self - service community templates , as well as those built on the salesforce tabs + visualforce template .
it can be added to new communities created after the summer ‘ 15 release or to communities that have been upgraded to the summer ‘ 15 templates .
new features for support agents support agents using the community case feed can scan case interactions and collaborate with customers and other agents without leaving the console .

note :  prior to summer ‘ 15 , agents used the community action to make case comments and specified who could see the comment by selecting customer or everyone .
posting on a case with the community action makes the post visible to all internal and external users with access to the case : if a case originates from a question in the community , the community action displays two options : • select customer case to make a post visible to all internal and external users with access to the case .
• select community question to post a public answer on the community user ’s question .
note :  you can still use the post , file , and link actions in the console to communicate with external users on a case .
just be sure to select all with access in the audience drop - down menu .
edit the visibility of published case posts when necessary , agents can change the external visibility of a published text , link , or file post on a case .
this option is available only if the compact case feed is enabled .
in the post ’s drop - down menu in the compact case feed , agents can select make public to make an internal post visible to external users with access to a case .
conversely , selecting make private makes a post visible to internal users only .
making a post private means a customer no longer sees the post in their case feed .
however , keep in mind that the customer could have been notified by email when it was first posted .
to edit chatter posts on a case , agents need the “
edit my own posts ” and “ edit posts on records i own ” user permissions . 185 salesforce summer ’15 release notes service communities in

improved twitter direct message experience agents now have better information when they switch from a public to private twitter conversation .
direct messaging is the best practice for exchanging non - public information with a customer on social networks .
agents can transition from public to private conversations on twitter easily ; increasing productivity and decreasing errors , creating smoother conversations with customers and better service experiences . 188 salesforce summer ’15 release notes social customer service on twitter , two parties must be mutually following each other .

case creation option with the starter pack if you use the starter pack , you can now control which social accounts create cases on each inbound social post .
not all posts require a case , for example , a complimentary tweet or post does not need agent assistance .
the full social customer service version allows administrators to control which posts create cases in the social studio ( radian6 ) social hub .
now , starter pack administrators can decide whether they want cases created automatically or not when posts come from a particular social account .
for example , if you have two twitter handles , one for support and one for marketing or brand - focused information , you can have cases created automatically only from the support handle .
the tweets from the marketing handle go in a social post queue for review .
see “ managing social posts ” in the salesforce help .
additional social post fields if you are using the full social customer service version , not the starter pack , and classifiers in social studio ( radian6 ) social hub , four more fields are available on the social post object : analyzer score , language , classification , and engagement level .
189 salesforce summer ’15 release notes social customer service analyzer score analyzer score lets you score the relevance and importance of a social post .
you can set up your own custom relevancy system using all the conditions available in the social hub including number of followers , strong wording , library and proximity .
you then define and weigh each of your criteria , add and subtract to a score you associate to the post .
once in salesforce , agents can make routing and priority decisions based on this score .
language language identifies which language the social post is written in .
classification classification helps answer the question : “ why are they posting ? ” and separates posts into themes .
engagement level engagement level reflects the workflow status of the post at the time it was sent .
with these fields , agents have the information they need to route social posts and cases to the correct teams .
you can also customize your apex class to assign cases appropriately .
delete outbound posts on google+ and sina weibo ( pilot ) agents can now delete outbound comments in google+ and sina weibo .

other changes for social customer service learn about other changes that affect your social customer service users .
external communities users can view social posts administrators can now give social post read access to external community and portal users , giving their customers a complete history of their cases directly in the community .
there are three requirements to make social posts available in communities and portals . 1 .
ensure the user has access to cases in the community .
2 . give users read permission to social posts on their profiles .
3 .
on your organization ’s social post object , enable visibility to individual fields through the field level security settings .
note :  once these requirements are met , external users can see all social posts exposed to them .
for example , if a case or lead feed is exposed externally , all social posts in the feed are visible .
there is currently no way to limit visibility at the social post object level .
191 salesforce summer ’15 release notes assets new field on social persona object there is a new field on newly created social personas to indicate which social network created the persona .
this field is set on creation and is not updateable .
social personas created prior to summer 15 do not have this field .
note :  if your organization uses custom apex , you need to update it to use this field .
keep in mind that personas created before the summer 15 release do not have the field .
new functionalilty for quoted tweets .
quoted tweets have two parts : the original source tweet and the added comments by the retweeter .
salesforce can match by keyword on both the original tweet and the retweet comments .
however , currently only the retweeter 's comments are visible in social customer service .
therefore , it is possible for an agent to receive a quoted tweet to work on for no obvious reason , and the agent must view the post natively on the twitter website to get the full context .
longer twitter direct messages you can now send direct message of up to 10000 characters .

metadata now supported in organization sync
for data to remain synced in organization sync , the metadata in your primary salesforce organization must match the metadata in your secondary organization .
you can now choose to have certain types of metadata changes synced daily between your organizations .
inserts and updates of the following types of metadata are synced daily in one direction — from the primary to the secondary organization . • apex classes , components , and pages • custom fields • custom objects • external objects • layouts • permission sets • record types •
roles • user profiles editions organization sync is available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions the following actions on supported metadata are n’t synced and must be repeated in both organizations : • creating or updating metadata in the secondary organization • deleting metadata in either organization for example , if a user in the primary organization creates or updates a permission set , the change is applied to the secondary organization within 24 hours .
however , if the permission set is updated in the secondary organization , the update does n’t flow back to the primary organization , and the update in the secondary organization is overwritten in the next sync .
customers can opt to sync metadata by selecting the sync metadata option when setting up a replication connection .
for customers with existing replication connections , this option is on the connection detail page of your connection .
see “
duplicate your metadata ” in the salesforce help to learn best practices for syncing metadata .

193 salesforce summer ’15 release notes auto - published fields improve your service cloud implementation with code : introducing the service cloud cookbook if you publish an object to the linked organization in your replication connection , that object ’s fields are automatically published .
you can still edit which fields are published via the connection detail page .
this change just saves you some clicking time .
the following field types are n’t supported : • rich text area ( rta ) fields • formula fields • roll - up summary fields • fields that have a lookup to an unpublished object note :  this change does n’t apply to standard salesforce to salesforce connections .
automatic user sync users are now automatically synced in organization sync .
as soon as you create a replication connection , all users with standard user licenses are copied to the secondary organization .
when a user is created , updated , or deactivated , that change is automatically applied to both organizations .
note :  if you choose not to sync metadata in organization sync , add users to the secondary organization by clicking bulk sync users at the top of the connection detail page .
create triggers and reports for the organization sync log the organization sync log lists data and metadata that failed to sync .
you can write apex triggers for the log to notify you or others about log entries .
for example : • write a trigger that emails the administrator if more than 10 new entries appeared in the log in the past 24 hours . •
if an entry appears in the log for an account , trigger a workflow rule that flags the account with a “ needs review ” flag .
to create triggers for the organization sync log , from setup , select salesforce to salesforce > org sync log > triggers .
you can also create custom report types to monitor the health of your organization sync environment .
use the org sync log object as the primary object or as the secondary object to any object supported in organization sync ( for example , accounts or contacts ) .
for example : • create a custom report on the case object that shows all log entries for records related to a case in the last month . •
create a dashboard with reports that show : – the number of log entries in the past 24 hours –
the number of log entries by field type note :  because the log displays outgoing syncing failures , the same report shows different results depending on which organization you ’re working in .

distribute a managed version of salesforce files sync ( beta ) the managed version feature of salesforce files sync that was piloted in the spring ' 15 release is now in beta for summer ‘ 15 .
this feature allows it administrators to deploy the salesforce files sync desktop client at scale .
note :  the managed version of salesforce files sync is in beta and has known limitations .
we welcome your feedback on the idea exchange .
managed version can be deployed in an organization by it administrators using a group policy or configuration management software .
enabling the managed version disables all user - accessible download links and banners for the files sync client in salesforce , so it administrators become the only ones who can deploy and upgrade files sync .
what ’s new in the beta version ?
pilot customers gave us feedback while using this feature .
now in beta , managed version installs the salesforce files sync client in the users’ program files directory instead of in \users .
access the managed version settings in setup > administer > desktop administration > salesforce files sync settings .

unified user digest ( beta ) get the redesigned user digest email that ’s more mobile friendly , better organized , and better coordinated with group digests .
editions enterprise available in : • group •
professional • • performance • unlimited • contact manager • developer note :  this release contains a beta version of unified user digest that is production quality but has known limitations .
for information on enabling this feature for your organization , contact salesforce .
the unified user digest gives your users : • a new format that ’s easier to read on mobile devices • posts organized by priority so the most critical information comes first • posts organized under their parent group or object • group pictures for easier recognition • field values on records to summarize the status of the account , contact , case , or custom object •
reduced overlap with group digests by excluding posts already included in group digests contact your account executive or open a case with support to enable the unified user digest beta .
after it ’s enabled , go to setup and click customize > chatter > email settings and select enable user digest beta .
the unified user digest uses an object ’s primary compact layout to determine which fields are displayed .
in most cases , the system default compact layout contains the most useful set of fields , but you can improve the user experience by creating a custom compact layout and setting it as the primary .
we recommend limiting the total number of fields to four or fewer .
users see only fields that they have access to .
note the following field value limitations : • field values are not localized •
some data types , such as checkboxes , are not rendered optimally for more information , see compact layout overview in the salesforce help .
tip :
enabling the beta does n’t change users’ email settings .
to take advantage of the beta and to streamline email volume for your users , we recommend : • setting the personal digest frequency to daily • changing daily and weekly group digests to never • keeping email on each post group digests the same see also : ideaexchange : one digest for all community groups 207 salesforce summer ’15 release notes other changes in chatter other changes in chatter smaller changes that improve your experience with chatter .

improved sandbox copy engine for full sandboxes ( generally available ) we ’ve rebuilt our sandbox copy engine to optimize performance , scalability , and customer success .
the new engine impacts full sandboxes as they are created and existing full sandboxes as they are refreshed .
editions several enhancements to the copy engine make sandbox creation and refresh faster and minimize sandbox inconsistencies .
these improvements are available on a rolling basis during the summer ’15 release .
intelligent routing the copy engine selects the best instance for your sandbox based on available storage space , cpu consumption , and import activity on each sandbox instance .
new data copy framework available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • database.com
the copy engine divides your organization ’s data into small chunks for exporting and copying to the sandbox .
copying is faster , because chunks are processed in parallel .
importing begins as soon as the first data chunk is exported .
export and import are independent , so the system is robust and flexible .
209 salesforce summer ’15 release notes match production licenses to sandbox without a refresh new post - copy framework if a production organization changes during sandbox creation or refresh , the sandbox can contain data inconsistencies .
the new automated post - copy process quickly fixes these inconsistencies after copying is complete and tracks the fixes .

210 salesforce summer ’15 release notes general deployment enhancements general deployment enhancements deployment enhancements shorten your deployment times to production and give you more control over test execution in sandbox deployments .
also , the force.com migration tool has expanded support for deploying recent validations and canceling deployments .
these deployment enhancements do n’t apply to change sets .
see related metadata api changes in metadata types and fields .
in
this section : editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer choose which tests to run in a deployment test levels enable you to have more control over which tests are run in a deployment .
to shorten deployment time to production , run a subset of tests when deploying apex components .
the default test execution behavior in production has also changed .
by default , if no test level is specified , no tests are executed , unless your deployment package contains apex classes or triggers .
run local tests in a sandbox deployment you can now choose which tests to run in sandbox deployments to match the test run behavior in production .
previously , if you enabled tests in your sandbox deployment , you could n’t exclude managed package tests .
force.com migration tool enhancements the force.com migration tool has been enhanced to support deploying recent validations , canceling a deployment , and authenticating with a session id .
choose which tests to run in a deployment test levels enable you to have more control over which tests are run in a deployment .
to shorten deployment time to production , run a subset of tests when deploying apex components .
the default test execution behavior in production has also changed .
by default , if no test level is specified , no tests are executed , unless your deployment package contains apex classes or triggers .
as part of this change , the runalltests  deployment option is now replaced with testlevel . you can choose which tests to run in a deployment by setting the desired test level .
for a description of all test levels , see test levels for the deploy ( ) call .
in particular , to run a subset of tests in a deployment , set testlevel  to the runspecifiedtests  value and specify the tests to run in the runtests  option .
when running a subset of tests , code coverage is computed for each class and trigger individually and is different than the overall coverage percentage .
if your deployment package contains apex classes and triggers , the executed tests must cover each class and trigger for a minimum of 75% code coverage .
if the code coverage of an apex component in the deployment is less than 75% , the deployment fails .
if one of the specified tests fails , the deployment also fails .
we recommend that you test your deployment in sandbox first to ensure that the specified tests cover each component sufficiently .
even if your organization ’s overall code coverage is 75% or more , the individual coverage of the apex components being deployed can be less .
if the code coverage requirement is n’t met , write more tests and include them in the deployment .
this change is in the metadata api and is exposed in tools that are based on metadata api , such as the force.com migration tool .
specify tests in the force.com migration tool to run a subset of tests in the force.com migration tool , add the testlevel="runspecifiedtests "  parameter to the deploy target .
specify each test class to run for a deploy target in a < runtest > < /runtest >  child element within the sf : deploy element .
add the test class name within the < runtest > < /runtest >  tags .
add as many runtest  tags as you need , one for each test class . 211 salesforce summer ’15 release notes general deployment enhancements this deploy target example shows three test classes .
salesforce runs these test classes when deploying this package .
< target name="deploycode " > < sf : deploy username="${sf.username } " password="${sf.password } " sessionid="${sf.sessionid } " serverurl="${sf.serverurl } " deployroot="codepkg " testlevel="runspecifiedtests " >
< runtest > testclass1</runtest > < runtest > testclass2</runtest > < runtest > testclass3</runtest > <
/sf : deploy > < /target
> specify tests in metadata api to run a subset of tests by using the metadata api , set the runspecifiedtests  test level on the deployoptions  object .
next , specify each test class to run in deployoptions .
finally , pass deployoptions  as an argument to the deploy ( ) call .
the following example performs those steps to run only the specified test classes . //
create the deployoptions object .
deployoptions deployoptions = new deployoptions ( ) ; //
set the appropriate test level .
deployoptions.settestlevel(testlevel .
runspecifiedtests ) ; // specify the test classes to run . //
string array contains test class names .
string [ ] tests = { " testclass1 " , " testclass2 " , " testclass3 " } ; //
add the test class names array to the deployment options .
deployoptions.setruntests(tests ) ; //
call deploy ( ) by passing the deployment options object as an argument .
asyncresult asyncresult = metadatabinding.deploy(zipbytes,deployoptions ) ; considerations for running specific tests • you can only specify test classes .
you ca n’t specify individual test methods . •
we recommend that you refactor test classes to include the minimum number of tests that meet code coverage requirements .
refactoring your test classes can contribute to shorter test execution times , and as a result , shorter deployment times . •
you can deactivate a trigger in the target organization by deploying it with an inactive state .
however , the trigger must have been previously deployed with an active state .
default test execution in production when no test level is specified in the deployment options , the default test execution behavior depends on the contents of your deployment package .
when deploying to production , all tests , except those that originate from managed packages , are executed if your deployment package contains apex classes or triggers .
if your package does n’t contain apex components , no tests are run by default .
in api version 33.0 and earlier , tests were run for components that required tests , such as custom objects , and not only for apex components .
for example , if your package contains a custom object , all tests are run in api version 33.0 and earlier .
in contrast , starting with api version 34.0 , no tests are run for this package .
the api version corresponds to the version of your api client or the version of the tool you ’re using ( force.com migration tool ) .
212 salesforce summer ’15 release notes general deployment enhancements you can run tests for a deployment of non - apex components .
you can override the default test execution behavior by setting the test level in your deployment options .
test levels are enforced regardless of the types of components present in your deployment package .
we recommend that you run all local tests in your development environment , such as sandbox , prior to deploying to production .
running tests in your development environment reduces the amount of tests needed to run in a production deployment .
run local tests in a sandbox deployment you can now choose which tests to run in sandbox deployments to match the test run behavior in production .
previously , if you enabled tests in your sandbox deployment , you could n’t exclude managed package tests .
as part of this change , the runalltests  deployment option has been replaced with testlevel .
for a description of all test levels that you can use in your development environment , see test levels for the deploy ( ) call .
for example , to run local tests in a deployment and to exclude managed package tests , set testlevel  to the runlocaltests value .
note :  the runlocaltests test level is enforced regardless of the contents of the deployment package .
in contrast , tests are executed by default in production only if your deployment package contains apex classes or triggers .
you can use runlocaltests  for sandbox and production deployments .
if you ’re using the force.com migration tool , add the testlevel="runlocaltests "  parameter to the deploy target , as shown in this example .
< target name="deploycode " > < sf : deploy username="${sf.username } " password="${sf.password } " sessionid="${sf.sessionid } " serverurl="${sf.serverurl } " deployroot="codepkg " testlevel="runlocaltests " > <
/sf : deploy > < /target
> if you ’re using metadata api , set the test level on the deployoptions  object to testlevel .
runlocaltests  and then pass this object as an argument to the deploy ( )  call as follows .
//
create the deployoptions object .
deployoptions deployoptions = new deployoptions ( ) ; //
set the appropriate test level .
deployoptions.settestlevel(testlevel .
runlocaltests ) ; //
call deploy ( ) by passing the deployment options object as an argument .

support for sf : canceldeploy  starts with version 34.0 of the force.com migration tool .
use a session id for authentication when you run the force.com migration tool to perform a migration , you can authenticate with a session id instead of a username and password .
using session id authentication provides more flexibility .
the force.com migration tool build.properties file has been updated to include the sf.sessionid  property .
similarly , the sample targets in the build.xml  file have been updated to include the sessionid  parameter .
to use the session id for authentication , uncomment this property in build.properties  and add a value for the session id .
in addition , comment out the sf.username  and sf.password  property pair .
both properties ca n’t be present at the same time .
the following is the session id property in build.properties .
sf.sessionid = < insert your salesforce session id here .

we 've now added error logging to help you when your jobs do n't execute .
error messages are available via the tooling api and also appear with the job run information in the developer console .
lightning connect we ’ve expanded your options for seamlessly interacting with data that ’s stored outside your salesforce organization .
now you can provide your users with a complete view of the business — on demand , in real time , and without copying data into your organization .
process builder : more ways to use your data we expanded your options for automating business processes with improved support for formulas , new formula functions , and more options for updating fields .
you can now use multi - select picklists in more places and delete a process without the 12-hour wait .
we also updated the user interface to make it easier to manage versions , find and reference fields , and create chatter messages .
visual workflow : new variables and formulas , easier to delete we removed the 12-hour wait before you can delete a deactivated flow , and you can now validate picklist and multi - select picklist values .
in addition , we ’ve added details to the flow fault email to help you troubleshoot what happened in your flow .
globalization globalization tools help administrators manage resources that vary from country to country , such as currencies , languages , and translated content .
monitoring updates to event monitoring and login forensics improve your ability to track user activity in your organization .
we ’ve also introduced two new pilot programs : apex limit events and data leakage detection .

external data sources of type “

enable server - driven paging to let the external system control the page sizes and batch boundaries .
you can optimize the external system ’s paging settings to provide data to your organization more efficiently than client - driven paging .
the external system ’s paging settings can optimize the external system ’s performance and improve the load times for external objects in your organization .
also , the external data set can change while your users or the force.com platform are paging through the result set .
typically , server - driven paging adjusts batch boundaries to accommodate changing data sets more effectively than client - driven paging .
when you enable server - driven paging on an external data source , the external system ignores any specified batch or page sizes in queries .
how you enable server - driven paging depends on the lightning connect adapter . •
the salesforce adapter always uses server - driven paging . •
to enable server - driven paging for the odata 2.0 adapter , select server driven pagination  on the external data source .
by default , the odata 2.0 adapter uses client - driven paging , specifically by using the $ top and $ skip  system query options in odata requests . •
to enable server - driven paging for custom adapters , which you create with the apex connector framework , declare the query_pagination_server_driven capability on the getcapabilities  method in the adapter ’s datasource .
provider  class .
also , the apex code must generate a query token for fetching the next batch of results .
by default , custom adapters do n’t automatically support paging of any kind .
if you ca n’t implement server - driven paging , implement client - driven paging by using limit  and offset  clauses to page through result sets .
for more information about custom adapters , see access any data anywhere with the lightning connector apex framework on page 220 .
control whether to request total row counts in odata queries some external systems do n’t support the $ inlinecount = allpages  system query option .
when you try to access their data via the odata 2.0 adapter for lightning connect , you receive errors or notice long load times .
if needed , you can now exclude that system query option from odata queries for a specified external data source .
by default , salesforce sends each odata request with the $ inlinecount = allpages  system query option .
the response then includes the total row count after applying the $ filter  system query options that were in the request .
to disable $ inlinecount = allpages , deselect request row counts  on the external data source .
if you do so , however , the external data source and its associated external objects do n’t support the soql count ( )  aggregate function , which requires the total row count .
customize search layouts with the name field for external objects
previously , you could n't change whether or where a search layout included the name field for an external object .
now you can customize your search layouts to display an external object ’s name field in a specified position .
by default , the external id  standard field on the external object is the name field .
you can , however , select the is name field attribute on a different field to set that field as the name field for the external object .
view names of parent records in lookup relationship fields on external objects previously , a lookup relationship field on an external object record displayed the record id of the parent record .
now the lookup relationship field displays the parent record name , which is more relevant to your users

update fields with more value types we added more options for updating fields and made it easier to specify value types .
immediately delete a process after you deactivate a process , you no longer have to wait 12 hours before you delete it .
process builder user interface enhanced we ’ve improved the process builder user interface so it ’s easier to manage versions , find and reference fields , create chatter messages and more .
compare and return values in formulas use newly supported functions to compare and return values in the process builder .
these new functions are now available to use in formulas .
• includes • ischanged • isnew • ispickval • priorvalue
for example , check whether a case ’s contact changed by using ischanged([case].contactid ) .
if this formula evaluates to true , your process executes the associated actions .
227 salesforce summer ’15 release notes process builder : more ways to use your data note :  picklist fields are no longer evaluated as text fields in formulas .
if your process uses a formula to reference a picklist field ( for example , [ account].industry = ' agriculture ' ) , we recommend changing the formula to use text or ispickval instead ( for example , ispickval([account].industry ) = ' agriculture ' ) .
see also : ideaexchange : support isnew formula functions in process criteria ideaexchange : update picklist fields using formulas update fields using formulas and date functions when your process updates fields , you can now use formulas and date functions as the value .
for example , you can : •
use mathematical formulas to calculate values like pricing discounts , commission rates , and shipping costs .
• use relative date functions — like now ( )  and today()—when populating a date field , or set a date in the future when creating a record .
for example , check whether a case ’s contact changes by using ischanged([case].contactid ) .
if this formula evaluates to true , your process executes the associated actions .
this example shows how a formula is used to update the due date field on a task record related to a case .
the task due date is set for five days after the case closes .

we added a list of every flow element that the interview executed so that you can see the exact path the interview took .
for example , if your flow includes a decision element , use this list to figure out which route the interview took .
note :  this release contains a beta version of the flow fault email that is production quality but has known limitations .
we welcome your feedback on ideaexchange .
the beginning of the email identifies the errors that occurred and the element where each error occurred .
if the flow uses fault connectors , multiple errors can occur before the interview finishes .
the email also includes details about the flow and the interview that failed , as well as a list of the elements that the interview executed . 237 salesforce summer ’15 release
notes globalization • if the element that failed has a fault connector , the interview continues until the next error or until there are no more elements to execute .
the failed element is n’t necessarily the last one in the list .
in fact , multiple elements could have failed . •
if the element that failed does n’t have a fault connector , the interview stops at that element .
the failed element is the last element that ’s listed in the email .
use the list of elements to determine exactly which path the flow interview took .
for example , determine which way a decision element routed your interview .
example :  your flow calculates the discount for an opportunity based on its account ’s annual revenue .
you run an interview of that flow , and it fails .
the fault email that you receive begins with the following error message .
an error occurred at element submit_record .
no applicable approval process was found .
then it lists the elements that the interview executed .
record lookup : find_acct decision : determine_discount assignment : no_discount record update : update_discount_field subflow : submit_for_approval submit for approval : submit_record through this list , you see that the interview followed the path that we ’ve highlighted in green .
the interview failed in the flow that ’s referenced by the “

monitor data loss with data leakage detection ( pilot ) companies continue to view data loss as a major concern .
data leakage , when left undetected , makes it difficult to identify when a specific employee removes data from salesforce for their own purposes .
the data leakage detection pilot is designed so administrators can monitor and detect when users access data through the salesforce platform .
updates to the event monitoring feature event monitoring now includes even more functionality for tracking and analyzing events in your organization .
you can monitor cpu time and database request time to analyze performance and check whether bottlenecks are occurring in the database or in your code .

242 salesforce summer ’15 release notes monitoring track your organization ’s apex transactions with apex limit events ( pilot ) the apex limit events pilot allows you to monitor occurrences of non - zero governor limits in your organization .
editions apex is a strongly typed , object - oriented programming language .
it allows developers to execute flow and transaction control statements on the force.com platform server along with calls to the force.com api .
apex runs in a multitenant environment .
the runtime engine strictly enforces limits to ensure that any one organization ’s apex code does n’t monopolize shared resources .
if a piece of apex code ever exceeds a limit , the associated governor issues a runtime exception that ca n’t be handled .
available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer it ’s frustrating to hit these limits because it can cause mission - critical apps to fail .
but what if you could monitor these limits in a production environment ?
the apex limit events pilot provides api access to a stream of near real - time tracking of apex executions that hit a governor limit .
you can also access hourly roll - up summary metrics that help you monitor the ongoing health of your organization ’s apex executions .
note :  this pilot only supports monitoring of hard apex limits , not the newer soft limits .
note :  apex limit events is currently available through a pilot program .

data leakage , when left undetected , makes it difficult to identify when a specific employee removes data from salesforce for their own purposes .
the data leakage detection pilot is designed so administrators can monitor and detect when users access data through the salesforce platform .
users can access data through a programmatic interface such as the api or through a web interface like a browser .
the initial pilot of data leakage detection tracks queries in near real time in the soap , rest , and bulk apis .
because greater than half of all data accessed on the platform is performed via these apis , organizations can gain greater insights into : •
who saw what data •
when they saw that data • where they accessed the data • what fields they accessed • how long a query took •
how many records they accessed editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer when combined with the login forensics pilot , you can also track every query back to a unique login to identify anomalies in user behavior .

if you use images from a static resource , use the urlfor ( ) function to obtain the image url .
for example : editions available in : contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions < apex : mapmarker title= " { ! account .

billingstreet},{!account .
billingcity},{!account .
billingstate } " icon= " { ! urlfor($resource . mapmarkers , ' moderntower.png ' ) } " / > use a common graphics format , such as png , gif , or jpeg .
the preferred marker size is 32 × 32 pixels .
other sizes are scaled , which does n’t always produce ideal results .

the liveagent : clientchatcancelbutton is a new component available in api versions 34.0 and later .
it provides a button within a live agent chat window that a visitor can click to cancel a chat request before an agent accepts it .
the clientchatcancelbutton  attribute lets you customize the text of the button .
the default english label is “
cancel chat .
”
this corresponds to our new cancel chat feature .
new attribute for < liveagent : clientchatalertmessage >
the liveagent : clientchatalertmessage  component supports a new attribute , chatblockedlabel , in api versions 34.0 and later .
this attribute specifies the message that appears to a customer when an agent blocks that customer from a chat .
with this release , agents can now block chat customers from chatting with them .
for example , if a customer is verbally abusive to an agent , the agent can protect themselves and other agents by blocking that user ’s ip address from starting a new chat .
the chatblockedlabel  attribute lets you customize the message that appears to customers in the chat window after they ’ve been blocked .
this corresponds to our new block unwelcome chat visitors by ip address feature .

this feature was inadvertently disabled and is now restored .
this change affects the < label >  tags added by all visualforce input components .
the “ * ” annotation is added to required fields regardless of why the field is required — whether it ’s required by the data model , layout , or visualforce markup .
the “ * ” character does n’t appear when visualforce pages are viewed in a standard web browser .
for sighted users , there ’s no visible change in the way required fields are indicated .
remote action response encoding includes single straight quotation marks string values in a remote action response are encoded to escape characters , such as “ < ” and “ > ” , that have special meaning in html .
encoding now includes the single straight quotation mark character ( ' ) .
encoding response string values makes them safe to handle in your visualforce pages , with or without your own explicit encoding .
this change affects string values in the response , whether the response is a primitive single string , an sobject , or a collection of values .
enable clickjack protection for visualforce pages
even when headers are disabled clickjack protection secures your visualforce pages against user interface redress attacks .
you can enable clickjack protection for visualforce pages that suppress the standard header .
the setting is global to your organization and applies to all your visualforce pages .
to enable clickjack protection for visualforce pages that suppress the standard header , select enable clickjack protection for customer visualforce pages with headers disabled under setup > security controls > session settings .
clickjack protection is implemented by adding a x - frame - options : sameorigin  header to visualforce pages .
when headers are suppressed by setting showheader="false "  on a page , this header is n’t added to the page , and clickjack protection is disabled .
normally , suppressing headers is the desired behavior because it strips out unnecessary resources and provides a clean slate for your visualforce pages .
this new session setting lets you turn only the clickjack protection functionality back on , which adds the required header to your visualforce pages .
enabling clickjack protection for visualforce pages has some side effects .
when this header is activated , only pages served from the visualforce domain can wrap visualforce pages in an < iframe > , or otherwise embed visualforce pages .
some existing salesforce features embed visualforce in frames .
if you enable clickjack protection for visualforce pages , these features no longer work .
examples include custom console components in the salesforce console , custom dashboards that embed visualforce pages , and other features you have extended using visualforce .
we recommend that you test clickjack protection in a sandbox or developer edition organization to verify the behavior before enabling it in your production organization .
if your organization displays visualforce pages within a frame or < iframe > , it ’s possible that the clickjack - protected pages display either as a blank page or without the frame .
the behavior varies depending on your browser and its version .
although there are reasons to frame pages , hackers can abuse framed pages .
you have two options for handling existing framed visualforce pages .
• discontinue displaying these pages within a frame or < iframe>. this solution is recommended . •
do n’t enable clickjack protection for your visualforce pages .
this option allows you to continue framing visualforce pages , but the pages are vulnerable to clickjack attacks .
this option is n’t recommended .
note :  along with this new setting , labels for the existing clickjack protection settings are updated for consistency and clarity across all four clickjack settings .
the behavior of the existing settings is unchanged . 253 salesforce summer ’15 release notes visualforce reduced access for apex classes using with sharing keyword apex classes defined with the with sharing  keyword no longer have unfiltered access to the user object if it ’s set to private by the organization ’s sharing rules .
this keyword is often used in custom visualforce controllers and controller extensions .
for more information , see reduced access for apex classes using with sharing keyword on page 259 .
this change also applies to the visualforce standard controller .
since this is documented behavior , this change should n’t affect pages that use standard controllers .
serve static resources from the visualforce domain
this critical update changes the way that your static resources , such as images , javascript , and css files , are served from salesforce .
to avoid broken references to static resources , make sure that you review our recommended best practices .
prior to this release , some static resources , such as images and css files , were loaded from the salesforce domain .
with this update , all static resources are loaded from the visualforce domain .
changing the origin domain can cause absolute references to static resources to break .
it ’s a best practice to reference static resources by using the $ resource  global variable and the urlfor ( ) function instead of static strings .
for example : • < apex : includescript value="{!$resource .
myjavascriptfile}"/ > •
< apex : image url="{!urlfor($resource
. testzip , ' images / bluehills.jpg ' ) } " width="50 " height="50"/ > these references are safe to use regardless of your organization ’s settings .
we recommend that you test this update in a sandbox or developer edition organization to verify correct behavior of your pages before enabling it in your production organization .
to activate this critical update : 1 .
from setup , click critical updates .
2 . click activate for “ serve static resources from the visualforce domain . ”
pagereference getcontent ( ) and getcontentaspdf ( ) methods behave as callouts this critical update changes the way calls made to the pagereference methods getcontent ( ) and getcontentaspdf ( )  are treated and improves the semantics of the transaction for the calling page .
a pagereference is a reference to an instantiation of a visualforce page .
the getcontent ( )  and getcontentaspdf ( )  instance methods return the content of a rendered page as html and pdf , respectively .
with this update , calls made to these methods behave as callouts , and the calls are tracked against the limits of the calling transaction .
we recommend that you test this update in a sandbox or developer edition organization to verify correct behavior of your pages before enabling it in your production organization .

apex code apex code apex enhancements enable you to rely on the debug log 's order of precedence , and use location and distance bind variables .
also , enhancements include code coverage changes and new classes and methods .
for detailed information about these enhancements , refer to the force.com apex code developer 's guide .
editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , developer , and database.com editions in
this section : new code coverage calculation for multiline statements code coverage has changed for statements that are written on multiple lines .
each line that contains an expression is now included in the code coverage calculation for covered and uncovered code .
previously , a multiline statement was calculated as one line of code in code coverage .
this change affects all api versions .
iteration order for maps and sets is now predictable the order of elements in unordered collections ( map  and set ) is now the same each time your code is run .
previously , the order of elements in unordered collections was arbitrary , and you could n’t rely on the order of elements in maps and sets .
receive debug logs
predictably debug log levels now have a clear order of precedence .
previously , it was difficult to predict whether some events would be logged .
location and distance variables allowed in soql and sosl queries in apex you can now use location and distance variables within bind expressions in apex .
bind expressions let you reference apex variables in soql and sosl queries .
reduced access for apex classes using with sharing keyword apex classes defined with the with sharing  keyword no longer have unfiltered access to the user object if it ’s set to private by the organization ’s sharing rules .
in previous releases , the user object was exempt from the with sharing  keyword .
because organization - wide sharing defaults for the user object default to public read - only , this behavior had no effect in most organizations .
however , if an organization sets the organization - wide sharing defaults for the user object to private , the with sharing  keyword could produce unexpected results .
see apex method parameters at a glance method topic titles in the force.com apex code developer ’s guide now include sample parameter names .
previously , topic titles for apex methods stated the data types of the parameters to be passed to the methods .
however , we received feedback that headings like methodname(string , string , boolean , string )  are n’t useful .
new and changed apex classes these classes , methods , annotations , and interfaces are new or have changed in this release .
new code coverage calculation for multiline statements code coverage has changed for statements that are written on multiple lines .
each line that contains an expression is now included in the code coverage calculation for covered and uncovered code .
previously , a multiline statement was calculated as one line of code in code coverage .
this change affects all api versions .
as a result of this change , code coverage numbers can sometimes be calculated differently from the calculation done in summer ’15 .
the new calculation can be higher or lower , depending on the scenario .
when multiline statements are present , more lines are counted as part of the code coverage calculation .
therefore , if those lines are covered , they can contribute to a higher coverage .
similarly , if those lines are n’t covered , they can contribute to a lower coverage .
255 salesforce summer ’15 release notes apex code this example shows how code coverage can be higher .
the following code snippet results in six lines that are counted toward code coverage .
those lines are integer n = getsomenumber1 ( ) , + getsomenumber2 ( ) , + getsomenumber3 ( ) , + getsomenumber4 ( ) ; , if ( myvar==true ) { , and notcovered();.
in this example , only the notcovered ( ) ; statement is n’t covered , so the total number of covered lines is five .
the code coverage is 5/6 or 83% .
previously , three lines of code were counted , because all the expressions in the first assignment statement ( integer n =) were counted as one line .
the code coverage was 2/3 or 66% .
this next example shows how code coverage can be lower .
the expressions in the if  condition result in three lines that are counted toward code coverage .
because fooreturnsfalse ( )  returns a false value , the remaining expressions in the condition are n’t evaluated , and therefore are n’t covered .
the code coverage is 1/3 or 33% .
previously , all three expressions in the if  condition were counted as one line for code coverage , and the code coverage was 1/1 or 100% .
note : • if a statement consists of multiple expressions and is written on one line , it ’s counted as one line for code coverage .
if one part of this statement is covered and other parts are n’t , the entire statement is counted as a covered line because it counts as one line total . •
the apex compiler sometimes optimizes expressions in a statement .
for example , if multiple string constants are concatenated with the +  operator , the compiler replaces those expressions with one string constant internally .
if the string concatenation expressions are on separate lines , the additional lines are n’t counted as part of the code coverage calculation after optimization .
256 salesforce summer ’15 release notes apex code to illustrate this point , a string variable is assigned to two string constants that are concatenated .
the second string constant is on a separate line .
string s = ' hello ' + ' world ! ' ; the compiler optimizes the string concatenation and represents the string as one string constant internally .
the second line in this example is ignored for code coverage .
string s = ' hello world ! ' ; see also : understanding expressions testing and code coverage iteration order for maps and sets is now predictable the order of elements in unordered collections ( map  and set ) is now the same each time your code is run .
previously , the order of elements in unordered collections was arbitrary , and you could n’t rely on the order of elements in maps and sets .
ideally , you do n’t want your code to depend on the order of elements in unordered collections .
if you have such code , it could sometimes fail before this change .
this change makes your code more robust because the iteration order in maps and sets is always the same .
this example illustrates how the iteration order is deterministic in a map .
a map is created with two elements .
next , the for  loop iterates over the map elements and writes the key and value of each element to the debug log .
each time you execute this snippet , the iteration order of the elements in the for  loop is the same .
map < string , string > currencymap = new map < string , string > ( ) ; currencymap.put('france','euro ' ) ; currencymap.put('japan ' , ' yen ' ) ; //
iterate through the map elements . for ( string mapkey : currencymap.keyset ( ) ) { system.debug('key : ' + mapkey + ' , value : ' + currencymap.get(mapkey ) ) ; } //
the output is :
key : france , value : euro key : japan , value : yen note :  a critical update for this change ( predictable iteration order for apex unordered collections ) was added before summer ’15 .
this update provided you time to test your applications to ensure that the change caused no failures or to fix failures that occurred .
in rare cases , the change causes your order - dependent logic to fail .
this update is now applied to all organizations and api versions .
receive debug logs
predictably debug log levels now have a clear order of precedence .
previously , it was difficult to predict whether some events would be logged .
the order of precedence for debug log levels is : 1 .
trace flags set in the developer console override all other logging logic .
the developer console sets a trace flag when it loads , and that trace flag remains in effect until it expires .
257 salesforce summer ’15 release notes apex code to access your trace flags and their expiration times , open the developer console and click debug > change log levels . • •
to add trace flags for a class or trigger , click add , select a class or trigger , and then click add .
double - click fields to adjust your log levels .
note :  setting trace flags does n’t cause logs to be generated or saved .
trace flags override other logging levels , but they do n’t cause logging to occur .
if logging is enabled when classes or triggers execute , logs are generated at the time of execution . 2 .
if you do n’t have active trace flags , synchronous and asynchronous apex tests execute with the default logging levels .
default logging levels are : db info apex_code debug apex_profiling info workflow info validation info callout info visualforce info system debug 3 .
4 . 5 .
if no relevant trace flags are active , and no tests are running , your api header sets your logging levels .
api requests that are sent without debugging headers generate transient logs — logs that are n’t saved — unless another logging rule is in effect .
for more information , see “ debuggingheader ” in the force.com apex code developer 's guide .
if you enable system logs for a user , you get debug logs for that user ’s next 20 requests .
to learn how to set up user - based debug logs , see “ monitoring debug logs ” in the salesforce help .
if your entry point sets a log level , that log level is used .
for example , visualforce requests can include a debugging parameter that sets log levels .
if none of these cases apply , logs are n’t generated or persisted .
for more information on debug log levels , see “ working with logs in the developer console ” in the force.com apex code developer 's guide .
location and distance variables allowed in soql and sosl queries in apex you can now use location and distance variables within bind expressions in apex .
bind expressions let you reference apex variables in soql and sosl queries .
soql and sosl statements in apex can reference apex code variables and expressions if they ’re preceded by a colon ( :) .
this use of a local code variable within a soql or sosl statement is called a bind .
the apex parser first evaluates the local variable in code context before executing the soql or sosl statement .
258 salesforce summer ’15 release notes apex code these queries are now allowed .
double mylatitude = 10 ; double mylongitude = 10 ; list < account >
accountlist = [ select i d , name , billinglatitude , billinglongitude from account where distance(my_location_field__c , geolocation(:mylatitude , : mylongitude ) , ' mi ' ) < 10 ] ; location mylocation = location.newinstance(10 , 10 ) ; double mydistance = 100 ; list < account > accountlist = [ select i d , name , billinglatitude , billinglongitude from account where distance(my_location_field__c , : mylocation , ' mi ' ) < : mydistance ] ; apex bind variables are n’t supported for the units parameter in distance  or geolocation  functions .
this query does n’t work .
string units = ' mi ' ; list < account > accountlist = [ select id , name , billinglatitude , billinglongitude from account where distance(my_location_field__c , geolocation(10,10 ) , : units ) < 10 ] ; reduced access for apex classes using with sharing keyword apex classes defined with the with sharing  keyword no longer have unfiltered access to the user object if it ’s set to private by the organization ’s sharing rules .
in previous releases , the user object was exempt from the with sharing  keyword .
because organization - wide sharing defaults for the user object default to public read - only , this behavior had no effect in most organizations .
however , if an organization sets the organization - wide sharing defaults for the user object to private , the with sharing  keyword could produce unexpected results .
by default , apex code runs in the system context and has full access to all of an organization ’s data .
the with sharing  keyword tells the class to take the sharing rules for the current user into account when accessing data .
for more information , see “
using the with sharing  or without sharing  keywords ” in the force.com apex code developer 's guide .
beginning in api version 34.0 , the user object is no longer exempt from the additional filtering that results from the with sharing keyword .
this change is versioned .
update your code to api version 34.0 or later to access the new behavior .
if you have code that depends on the old behavior , you have two options to preserve compatibility . •
do n’t update affected apex classes beyond api version 33.0 .
• change the affected classes to use without sharing  and implement any filtering based on the context user yourself .
see apex method parameters at a glance method topic titles in the force.com apex code developer ’s guide now include sample parameter names .
previously , topic titles for apex methods stated the data types of the parameters to be passed to the methods .
however , we received feedback that headings like methodname(string , string , boolean , string )  are n’t useful .
we ’ve also standardized our parameter name format and clarified some parameter names .
to see the new method headings , check out the reference chapter of the summer ’15 version of the force.com apex code developer ’s guide .
259 salesforce summer ’15 release notes apex code new and changed apex classes these classes , methods , annotations , and interfaces are new or have changed in this release .
new methods the following existing classes have new methods .
auth .
authconfiguration  class getforgotpasswordurl ( ) returns the url for the standard or custom forgot password page that is specified for a community or portal by the administrator .
reports .
reportmetadata  class
these methods enable you to get or set report properties , such as the division , whether the report has detailed data , whether the report includes the record count , the scope of the data , the field used for sorting , standard date filters , and default filters .
the new methods are : • getdivision • gethasdetailrows • gethasrecordcount •
getscope • getsortby • getstandarddatefilter •
getstandardfilters • setdivision • sethasdetailrows • sethasrecordcount • setscope
• setsortby •
setstandarddatefilter •
setstandardfilters the reporting rest api also exposes report metadata properties . see changed salesforce1 reporting rest api request and response bodies .
system .
search  class find(string ) performs a search using a dynamic sosl query that can include a with snippet  clause .
snippets provide context for salesforce knowledge article search results so that users can identify the content they ’re looking for .
suggest(string , string , search .
suggestionoption ) returns a list of records or salesforce knowledge articles whose names or titles match the user ’s search query string .
use this method to provide users with shortcuts to navigate to relevant records or articles before they perform a search .
system .
site  class use the createexternaluser ( )  methods instead of the createportaluser ( )  for better error handling .
each method creates a new community or portal user and associates them with the specified account in a community or portal .
each method throws site .
externalusercreateexception  when user creation fails .
createexternaluser(name , accountid ) creates a community or a portal user for the given account and associates it with the community .
260 salesforce summer ’15 release notes apex code createexternaluser(name , accountid , password ) creates a community or a portal user for the given account and associates it with the community .
this method sends an email with the specified password to the user .
createexternaluser(name , accountid , password , sendemailconfirmation ) creates a community or portal user and associates it with the given account .
this method sends the user an email with the specified password as well as a new user confirmation email .
system .
string  class equals(stringorid ) returns true  if the passed - in object is not null and represents the same binary sequence of characters as the current string .
use this method to compare a string to an object that represents a string or an id .
the new equals(object )  method replaces equals(string ) , which is deprecated .
previously , you could compare a string to an id by using the equals(string )  method , because the apex runtime converts ids to strings .
the new equals(object )  method compares the current string to any object , including a string or an id .
this new method provides more robust handling of string - to - id comparisons .
changed methods the following classes have changed methods .
system .
date  class valueof(fieldvalue )
in api version 33.0 or earlier , if you call date.valueof  with an object that represents a datetime , the method returns a date  value that contains the hours , minutes , and seconds .
in version 34.0 and later , date.valueof converts the object to a valid date  without the time information .
to convert a variable of type datetime  to a date , use the datetime.date method .
new properties the following classes have new properties . dmloptions . duplicateruleheader class includerecorddetails set to true  to get fields and values for records detected as duplicates .
set to false  to get only record ids for records detected as duplicates .
runascurrentuser set to true  to make sure that sharing rules for the current user are enforced when duplicate rules run .
set to false  to use the sharing rules specified in the class for the request .
if no sharing rules are specified , apex code runs in system context and sharing rules for the current user are not enforced .
new classes the following classes have been added .
classes in the datasource  namespace a new namespace , datasource , and classes have been added for the apex connector framework .
those classes enable you to create a custom adapter for lightning connect to access data that ’s stored outside your salesforce organization .
see access

these methods use other connectapi  classes to input and return information .
the connectapi  namespace is referred to as chatter in apex .
in apex , it ’s possible to access some chatter data using soql queries and objects .
however , connectapi  classes expose chatter data in a much simpler way .
data is localized and structured for display .
for example , instead of making many calls to access and assemble a feed , you can do it with a single call .
note :  to integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third party web applications with chatter and communities , use chatter rest api .

lightning components
the lightning component framework powers salesforce1 .
use the framework to build mobile apps and pages faster than ever .
use out - of - the - box components or build your own components with javascript , html , css , apex , or any web - enabled code .
the appexchange for components enables you to install components created by salesforce partners or publish your own components .
for more information , refer to the lightning components developer ’s guide .
editions available for use in : contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions create lightning components using the ui in enterprise , performance , unlimited , developer editions or a sandbox . 268 salesforce summer ’15 release notes lightning components in
this section : standalone lightning apps ( generally available ) lightning components in standalone apps ( .app  resources ) are generally available .
integrating lightning components with salesforce1 is in a beta release that is production quality but has some limitations .
lightning components components help you build apps faster .
use them in your lightning apps or in salesforce1 .
lightning events events add a layer of interaction to your components .
other changes in lightning components we ’ve made additional changes in lightning components .
standalone lightning apps ( generally available ) lightning components in standalone apps ( .app  resources ) are generally available .
integrating lightning components with salesforce1 is in a beta release that is production quality but has some limitations .
lightning components in standalone apps are available by default .
you can enable lightning components in salesforce1 from setup by navigating to develop > lightning components .
lightning components components help you build apps faster .
use them in your lightning apps or in salesforce1 .
changed components the following components now have simpler body structures that improve performance .
these performance enhancements enable components to load faster , especially in apps or pages with large numbers of input and output components , such as the record edit page in salesforce1 .
ui : input you can no longer pass a body into an input component that extends ui : input .
for example , you can no longer pass a body in ui : inputcheckbox  to override the body that ui : inputcheckbox  provides .
ui : outputemail < /span
> the root element of this component is now a < span >  tag .
the client - side controller for ui : outputemail  now contains the logic that appends a mailto :  prefix to a given text value , which renders like the following example .
< span class="uioutputemail " >
< a href="mailto:abc@email.com">abc@email.com</a > ui : outputphone the client - side controller for ui : outputphone  now contains the logic that appends a tel :  prefix to a given value on mobile devices .
this change is a performance enhancement and does n’t affect your implementation .
ui : outputurl the client - side controller for ui : outputurl  now contains the logic that builds the body of the < a >  tag , based on whether the iconclass  attribute is used .
this change is a performance enhancement and does n’t affect your implementation . 269 salesforce summer ’15 release notes lightning components lightning events events add a layer of interaction to your components .
the following ui  events are now available .
event name ui : clearerrors ui : validationerror description indicates that any validation errors should be cleared .
indicates that the component has validation errors .
other changes in lightning components we ’ve made additional changes in lightning components .
in
this section : use my domain with lightning components lightning components now work if you use custom domains with my domain .
use custom labels in lightning components use custom labels in lightning components with the $ label  global value provider .
new empty ( ) expression function the empty(v.attributename )  function returns true  if the argument is empty .
create picklists for lightning app builder components you can now render string fields as picklists in custom lightning components you ’ve configured for the lightning app builder .
changes to design files for lightning app builder components we made two changes to what design files support for lightning app builder components .
referential integrity validation expanded an expanded range of changes to lightning components and component dependencies are validated when saved to ensure that the changes do n’t break existing code .
default namespace usable in more contexts the default namespace , “
c ” , which was introduced in the previous release , is available in additional contexts .
you can use the default namespace to refer to resources using < aura : dependency>. use app templates to customize startup screen for custom apps you can create custom templates for an app by creating a lightning component that extends the default aura : template template .
cache additional web resources using appcache in addition to the default appcache resources , you can cache additional resources like javascript files , css stylesheet files , and image files .
slimmed down the javascript api doc the javascript api section of the reference doc app has been filtered to only show the methods that you need to build lightning components .
270 salesforce summer ’15 release notes lightning components use my domain with lightning components lightning components now work if you use custom domains with my domain .
for more information about my domain , see the online help .
use custom labels in lightning components use custom labels in lightning components with the $ label  global value provider .
custom labels are custom text values that can be translated into any language salesforce supports .
custom labels enable developers to create multilingual applications by automatically presenting information ( for example , help text or error messages ) in a user 's native language .
use this syntax to access custom labels in lightning components : • $ label.c.labelname  for the default namespace • $ label.namespace.labelname  if your org has a namespace here are some examples .
label in a markup expression using the default namespace { ! $ label.c.labelname } label in javascript code if your org has a namespace $ a.get("$label.namespace.labelname " ) note :  custom labels referenced in a lightning component are not automatically added when you create a package containing the lightning component .
to include a custom label in a package , another member of the package , such as a visualforce page , must reference the custom label .
new empty ( ) expression function the empty(v.attributename )  function returns true  if the argument is empty .
this function works for arguments of type string , array , object , list , map , or set .
an empty argument is undefined , null , an empty array , or an empty string .
an object with no properties is not considered empty .
example :  { ! !
empty(v.myarray ) }  evaluates faster than { !
v.myarray & & v.myarray.length > 0 }  so we recommend empty ( )  to improve performance .
create picklists for lightning app builder components you can now render string fields as picklists in custom lightning components you ’ve configured for the lightning app builder .
to render a field as a picklist , add a datasource  onto the attribute in the design resource , like this : < design : attribute name="name " datasource="value1,value2,value3 " / > any string attribute with a datasource  in a design resource is treated as a picklist .
how the lightning app builder renders it depends on the data type that you define in the component .
for example : • < aura : attribute name="name " type="string " / > renders as a picklist •
< aura : attribute name="name " type="string [ ] " / > renders as a multi - select picklist 271 salesforce summer ’15 release notes lightning components changes to design files for lightning app builder components we made two changes to what design files support for lightning app builder components .
design files no longer support the type  field .
define attribute types in the component file , then expose the attributes in the design file .
in addition , a design file now supports only attributes of type int , string , or boolean .
referential integrity validation expanded an expanded range of changes to lightning components and component dependencies are validated when saved to ensure that the changes do n’t break existing code .
you can reference component names , custom object and field names , class names , and so on in your lightning components markup .
when they change — for example , if you change the name of a custom component — code that references the changed item also needs to change .
in some cases — for example , changing the name of a custom object —
these changes are made automatically and happen behind the scenes .
in other instances , you need to make code changes manually .
in those cases , you receive a compilation error when you try to save the incompatible change .
referential integrity checking is expanded to include explicit dependency references using < aura : dependency >  and references that extend through an inheritance hierarchy .
references to custom fields are also validated and updated more thoroughly .
referential integrity validation still has a few gaps , mostly to do with references within javascript code and inside of expressions .
even complete validation ca n’t prevent many kinds of errors .
nevertheless , this validation makes it easier to refactor and grow your code , and gives you confidence as you do it .
default namespace usable in more contexts the default namespace , “
c ” , which was introduced in the previous release , is available in additional contexts .
you can use the default namespace to refer to resources using < aura : dependency>. here ’s an example of an explicit dependency using the default namespace .
< aura : dependency resource="markup://c : mycomponent " / >
previously , if your organization had a namespace set , you were required to use the full namespace .
it remains a best practice to always use your organization ’s namespace if it ’s set .
these changes make it easier to reuse code that ’s shared in articles , github repositories , and so on .
use app templates to customize startup screen for custom apps you can create custom templates for an app by creating a lightning component that extends the default aura : template  template .
for a sample app , this looks like : < aura : component istemplate="true " extends="aura : template " > < aura : set attrivute="title " value="doc sample"/ > ...
< /aura : component >
cache additional web resources using appcache in addition to the default appcache resources , you can cache additional resources like javascript files , css stylesheet files , and image files . 272 salesforce summer ’15 release notes api to specify these resources , add the additionalappcacheurls system attribute to the aura : application  tag in your .app  file .
the additionalappcacheurls  attribute value holds the urls of the additional resources .
note :  the useappcache="true "  attribute must also be set to enable caching .
slimmed down the javascript api doc the javascript api section of the reference doc app has been filtered to only show the methods that you need to build lightning components .
previously , the javascript api doc was showing many objects and methods that should only be used internally in the framework code so it was promoting anti - patterns for developers .
you should limit your code to only use the set of supported methods .
existing code that uses other methods will not break in this release but we are not guaranteeing support for these methods in future releases .
access the reference doc app at : https://<mysalesforceinstance>.lightning.force.com / auradocs / reference.app , where < mysalesforceinstance >  is the name of the instance hosting your org ; for example , na1 . api access more metadata types and data objects in api version 34.0 .

281 salesforce summer ’15 release notes api new resources composite resources salesforce introduces two composite resources for improving your application ’s performance by minimizing the number of round trips between client and server .
batch vxx.x / composite / batch the batch resource lets you execute a sequence of independent subrequests .
for example , you can update the name on an account and get the account ’s field values in a single request .
{ " batchrequests " : [ { " method " : " patch " , " url " : " v34.0/sobjects / account/001d000000k0fxoiaz " , " richinput " : { " name " : " newname " } } , { " method " : " get " , " url " : " v34.0/sobjects / account/001d000000k0fxoiaz " } ] } } the response contains the status codes of each subresponse and the responses themselves .
{ " haserrors " : false , " results " : [ { " statuscode " : 204 , " result " : null } , { " statuscode " : 200 , " result " : { account attributes } } ] the batch resource supports batching for the following resources and resource groups .
versions / resources by version vxx.x limits vxx.x / limits sobject resources vxx.x / sobjects/ query vxx.x / query/?q = soql queryall vxx.x / queryall/?q = soql 282 salesforce summer ’15 release notes api search vxx.x / search/?q = sosl connect resources vxx.x / connect/ chatter resources vxx.x / chatter/ sobject tree vxx.x / composite / tree note :  the sobject tree resource is available through a pilot program .
for information on enabling this resource for your organization , contact salesforce .
the sobject tree resource lets you create multiple sobject trees that share a root record type .
an sobject tree is a collection of nested , parent - child records with a single root record .
once the request is processed , the records are created and parents and children are automatically linked by id .
in the request data , you supply the record hierarchies , required and optional field values , each record ’s type , and a reference id for each record . { " records " : [ { " attributes " : { " type " : " account " , " referenceid " : " ref1 " } , " name " : " sampleaccount " , " phone " : " 1234567890 " , " website " : " www.salesforce.com " , " numberofemployees " : " 100 " , " type " : " analyst " , " industry " : " banking " , " contacts " : { " records " : [ { " attributes " : { " type " : " contact " , " referenceid " : " ref2 " } , " lastname " : " smith " , " title " : " president " , " email " : " sample@salesforce.com " } , { " attributes " : { " type " : " contact " , " referenceid " : " ref3 " } , " lastname " : " evans " , " title " : " vice president " , " email " : " sample@salesforce.com " } ] } } , { " attributes " : { " type " : " account " , " referenceid " : " ref4 " } , " name " : " sampleaccount2 " , " phone " : " 1234567890 " , " website " : " www.salesforce2.com " , " numberofemployees " : " 100 " , " type " : " analyst " , " industry " : " banking " } ] } 283 salesforce summer ’15 release notes api
upon success , the response contains the ids of the created records . { " haserrors " : false , " results " : [ { " referenceid " : " ref1 " , " i d " : " 001d000000k0fxoiaz " } , { " referenceid " : " ref2 " , " i d " : " 001d000000k0fxpiaz " } , { " referenceid " : " ref3 " , " i d " : " 003d000000qv9n2iad " } , { " referenceid " : " ref4 " , " i d " : " 003d000000qv9n3iad " } ] } if an error occurs while creating a record , the entire request fails and the response contains only the reference id of the record that caused the error and the error information .
a single request can contain up to 200 records .
because an sobject tree can contain a single record , you can use this resource to create up to 200 unrelated records of the same type . changed resources describe global /vxx.x / sobjects
the if - modified - since  http request header is now supported , enabling you to determine if an object ’s metadata has changed .
you can include the if - modified - since  header with a date in eee , dd mmm yyyy hh : mm : ss z  format when you use the describe global resource .
if you do , response metadata is returned only if an available object ’s metadata has changed since the provided date .
if no metadata has been modified since the provided date , a 304 not modified  status code is returned with no response body .
suggest article title matches /vxx.x
/ search / suggesttitlematches the suggest article title matches resource now suggests salesforce knowledge articles whose titles contain the entire query string , except stopwords , such as “ a , ” “ for , ” and “ the .
” results now include articles if their titles contain words from the query string in a different order .

duplicateerror contains information about an error that occurred when an attempt was made to save a duplicate record .
use if your organization has set up duplicate rules , which are part of the duplicate management feature .
the new statuscode  of duplicates_detected  is used for an error with a data type of duplicateerror .
duplicateresult represents the details of a duplicate rule that detected duplicate records and information about those duplicate records .
matchresult represents the duplicate results for a matching rule .
matchrecord represents a duplicate record detected by a matching rule
. 296 salesforce summer ’15 release notes api additionalinformationmap represents other information , if any , about matched records .
fielddiff represents the name of a matching rule field and how the values of the field compare for the duplicate and its matching record .
junctionidlist junction relations junctionidlist is a new field type .
junctionidlist field type starting in api version 34.0 , the junctionidlist  field type lets you manipulate the many - to - many relationship of an entity directly .
you no longer need to manipulate underlying junction entity records .
junctionidlist  fields can be queried and updated like any other field on the entity .
queries or updates to junctionidlist fields act as queries or updates to the underlying junction entity records .
fields of type junctionidlist  appear in the wsdl as an unbounded array of type id .
changed calls describeflexipages ( )  and describeflexipageresult the following field has been added : • region —
this field is reserved for future use .
describelayout ( )  and describelayoutresult
the following fields have been added : • feedview — feed view related layout data for a feed - based layout .
this field is null for page layouts that are not feed - based . •
describelayoutfeedfilter — represents an individual feed filter option that you can use to filter the feed .
• describelayoutfeedview — represents the layout of the feed view for a feed - based page layout .
the following type has been added to layoutcomponenttype : • analyticscloud — an analytics cloud dashboard on the page layout .
describesobjects ( )  and describesobjectresult the following field has been added to the field object : • encrypted — indicates whether this field is encrypted using platform encryption .
this value is available in api version 31.0 and later for backwards compatibility .
for more information , see comply with data protection requirements using platform encryption ( generally available ) .
metadata api use the metadata api to manage customization information , such as custom object definitions and page layouts , for your organization .
in
this section : metadata api calls metadata api calls were modified or added in version 34.0 . metadata types and fields metadata types and fields were modified or added in version 34.0 . metadata api calls metadata api calls were modified or added in version 34.0 .
297 salesforce summer ’15 release notes api updated metadata calls the following metadata api calls changed .
createmetadata ( ) , updatemetadata ( ) , upsertmetadata ( ) , and deletemetadata ( ) the default behavior for creating and updating sets of metadata components changed .
in api version 33.0 and earlier , the createmetadata ( ) , updatemetadata ( ) , and upsertmetadata ( )  calls saved all records only when there are no failures in any record in the call .
starting in api version 34.0 , the default behavior allows saving a partial set of records for records that have no errors .
the deletemetadata ( )  call allows saving a partial set of records in all api versions .
also , createmetadata ( ) , updatemetadata ( ) , upsertmetadata ( ) , and deletemetadata ( )  now support a new header , allornoneheader .
this header enables the rollback of all metadata changes when some of the records in a call result in failures .
when this header is set to true , changes are saved only when all records are processed successfully .
createmetadata ( ) , readmetadata ( ) , updatemetadata ( ) , and deletemetadata ( ) for custom metadata types only , the metadata  argument now has a limit of 200 .
checkretrievestatus ( )
the checkretrievestatus(id i d , boolean includezip )  call now accepts a second boolean parameter .
use this parameter to indicate whether to retrieve the zip file .
this optional parameter enables you to retrieve the zip file in a background service .
by default , checkretrievestatus ( )  returns the zip file on the last call when the retrieval is completed ( retrieveresult.isdone ( ) = = true )  and deletes the file from the server .
subsequent calls to checkretrievestatus ( )  for the same retrieve operation ca n’t retrieve the zip file after it has been deleted .
by using the includezip parameter , you can retrieve the zip file in a separate process after the retrieval operation is completed .
after the zip file is retrieved by passing true  to the boolean parameter , it is deleted from the server .
for example , a background file transfer service can call checkretrievestatus(id , true )  to retrieve the zip file .
this service is separate from another process that polls the retrieval status by calling checkretrievestatus(id , false )  in a loop .
describevaluetype ( ) ( valuetypefield ) valuetypefield contains the new field valuerequired .
this field indicates whether the described value type field must have a value ( true ) or can be null ( false ) .
valuetypefield is contained within describevaluetyperesult , which is the result that describevaluetype ( )  returns .
deploy ( ) a new deployment option , testlevel , has been added .
this option enables you to specify which tests to run in the deploy ( ) call .
the values of the testlevel  enumeration are : • notestrun — no tests are run .
this test level applies only to deployments to development environments , such as sandbox , developer edition , or trial organizations .
this test level is the default for development environments .
• runspecifiedtests — only the tests that you specify in the runtests  option are run .
code coverage requirements differ from the default coverage requirements when using this test level .
each class and trigger in the deployment package must be covered by the executed tests for a minimum of 75% code coverage .
this coverage is computed for each class and trigger individually and is different than the overall coverage percentage .
• runlocaltests — all tests in your organization are run , except the ones that originate from installed managed packages .
this test level is the default for production deployments that include apex classes or triggers . •
runalltestsinorg — all tests are run .
the tests include all tests in your organization , including tests of managed packages .
the runalltests  deployment option in the deployoptions object has been removed and is replaced by testlevel .

in complex packages , the number of components can grow very large over multiple release cycles .
deleting unused managed components allows you to keep your app clutter - free while you maintain and upgrade it .
important : • deleting a component permanently deletes the data that exists in that component , deletes tracked history data , and changes integrations that rely on the component , such as assignment or escalation rules .
when you delete a component in a managed package , you ca n’t restore it or create another component with the same api name .
however , no data or metadata is ever deleted in a subscriber organization without specific action by the customer .
subscribers who upgrade to the new package version still have the deleted components available in their organization .
they ’re displayed in the unused components section of the package details page .
keeping the components ensures that subscribers have the opportunity to export data and modify custom integrations that involve those components before explicitly deleting them . •
it ’s your responsibility to educate your customers about the potential impact of any components that you delete .
salesforce recommends that you list all deleted custom components and notify customers of required actions in the release notes for your upgrade package .
the following restrictions apply when deleting managed components . •
if a component is referenced by other metadata , such as workflow rules , validation rules , or apex classes , you ca n’t delete that component .
you can delete managed components declaratively from the user interface or programmatically using the metadata api .
in the latter case , specify the components you want to delete in a destructivechanges.xml  manifest file and then use the standard deploy ( )  call .
the process is identical to that for deleting components that are n’t managed .
for more information about the api , see the metadata api developer ’s guide .
for more information about deleting components in managed packages , see the isvforce guide .

308 salesforce summer ’15 release notes configure apps with custom metadata types ( generally available ) configure apps with custom metadata types ( generally available ) use custom metadata types to define configurations and create reusable app components and features that you can package and deploy .
you and others can then create custom metadata that uses the characteristics of the custom type .
editions platform developers commonly use custom settings or custom objects to define configurations and create reusable app components and features .
but because these entities’ records are data and not metadata , you ca n’t package , deploy , upgrade , and customize these types in a manageable way .
with custom metadata types , you can build apps defined and driven by your own types of metadata .
available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer •
database.com
with custom metadata types , you can : • speed your development by 25% by writing fewer deployment tools .
• use just a few custom metadata types to accomplish what previously took tens of thousands of lines of code .
• upgrade installed apps up to 50% faster .
the essential tasks for custom metadata types are : • create custom metadata types and records . •
create a user interface to accommodate the process of creating , editing , and deleting custom metadata records .
• package custom metadata types and records in unmanaged packages , managed packages , or managed package extensions . •
deploy packages that contain custom metadata types and records to professional , developer , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and database.com edition organizations .
• use change sets to deploy custom metadata types and records from a sandbox . •
use all field types that are available in custom settings , except for currency fields , in custom metadata types .
• use soql queries to retrieve data from custom metadata types and their records .
unlike other apex transactions , you can make unlimited soql queries for custom metadata types and records .

this section : comply with data protection requirements using platform encryption ( generally available ) platform encryption encrypts sensitive data for compliance with common regulatory requirements . 309 salesforce summer ’15 release notes security and identity data residency option ( dro ) feature retirement we are retiring the data residency option solution on august 15 , 2015 .
after that date , we will no longer support new installations , and we will discontinue support for existing installations .
while you can continue to use the dro solution , we ca n’t guarantee it will be compatible with future salesforce releases .
block login from users in restricted countries to comply with u.s. export control and economic laws and regulations , and salesforce ’s corporate policies , users with ips from restricted countries ca n’t log in to salesforce .
continuously enforce ip addresses in login ip ranges the enforce login ip ranges on every request  session settings option restricts the ip addresses from which users can access salesforce to only the ip addresses defined in login ip ranges .
this option affects all user profiles that have login ip restrictions .
track geographic location of user logins you can now track the geographic location of the ip addresses of user logins from the login history or session management pages , or by querying the logingeo object .
track authentication service by id with login history the authentication service id is now associated with a user ’s login history .
for example , this addition allows developers to create reports that track the saml or authentication provider configuration for a login event .
simplified oauth flows for external data sources and named credentials previously , oauth flows for external data sources and named credentials sometimes required users to click allow on two consent screens —
one for the external system and one for salesforce .
the salesforce consent screen no longer appears , simplifying the authentication process .
log in once for concurrent apps
that use openid connect after users log in and authorize an application to access their salesforce user data , they are n’t prompted to log in again when they authorize other applications .
this behavior applies to single sign - on using openid connect ( or oauth , if a user logs in to another salesforce app ) .
create single sign - on settings from a file or url you can configure saml for single sign - on by importing the settings from an xml file or public url , instead of having to specify them manually .
this streamlines setup and lets you use settings from your identity provider easily .
access saml metadata url for a community or custom domain you can share the saml configuration information for a community or custom domain with your service provider via a public url .
the url points to metadata that your service provider can conveniently use to configure single sign - on settings to connect to salesforce .
edit endpoints for google and linkedin authentication providers when you set up a google or linkedin authentication provider , you can now edit the authorize endpoint url  and token endpoint url .
in addition , you can edit the google user info endpoint url .
choose the logout page for salesforce users direct users to a specific logout destination that maintains your own branding experience after they log out of salesforce .
or , send them to a specific authentication provider ’s page .
test and use advanced networking protocols apex callouts , workflow outbound messaging , delegated authentication , and other https callouts now support transport layer security ( tls ) version 1.2 , tls 1.1 , and server name indication ( sni ) .
https callouts continue to support tls 1 .
we recommend that you test your callouts for compatibility in a sandbox before the upgrade .
310 salesforce summer ’15 release notes comply with data protection requirements using platform encryption ( generally available ) sms for identity confirmation renamed in session settings in session settings , under identity confirmation , the enable sms - based identity confirmation  setting is renamed .
the new name is enable the sms method of identity confirmation .
comply with fedramp standards by setting minimum password length at 15 characters we ’ve added the option to set the minimum password length for your organization at 15 characters .
requiring this minimum length puts your organization in compliance with united states federal risk and authorization management program ( fedramp ) and defense information systems agency ( disa ) security standards .
previously , the longest minimum password length you could require was 12 characters .
supported login flow types when you connect a login flow to a profile in your organization , only flows of type flow are supported .
two - factor authentication available for contact manager , group , and professional editions through permission sets you can now enable two - factor authentication in the contact manager , group , and professional editions by assigning a permission set to users . user provisioning for connected apps ( generally available ) automatically create , update , and delete user accounts on services , such as google and box , based on changes to user accounts in your salesforce organization or active directory service .
this feature dramatically reduces the time required to on - board new users , update user accounts , or deactivate accounts .
it also provides a centralized view of all user accounts across applications and services .
connected app improvements for finer control and easier administration salesforce introduces several changes to the administration of connected apps for quick adjustments to a connected app ’s configuration .
get a delegated approver using scim ( system for cross - domain identity management ) developers can use the rest api to get the id and display name of the assigned approver for an approval process from salesforce .
get quicker updates on my domain name propagation the time salesforce takes to check the status of the dns propagation of a new domain decreased from 10 minutes to 30 seconds .
this change means you can receive notification that your new domain propagation is complete sooner than in previous releases .
test your my domain login page settings before you deploy the domain to all users previously , you deployed a new domain to your users to test the login settings .
now , you can set up a new domain and test the login page settings without deploying the domain to all users .
comply with data protection requirements using platform encryption ( generally available ) platform encryption encrypts sensitive data for compliance with common regulatory requirements .
editions note :  you may need to purchase additional services or subscriptions to use this feature .
for pricing details , please contact your salesforce account executive .
platform encryption is not available if your instance is in the government cloud .
platform encryption lets customers encrypt data stored throughout salesforce , whether in the sales cloud , service cloud , or even custom apps .
encrypt sensitive , confidential , and private data at rest on the salesforce1 platform to help meet privacy policies , regulatory requirements , and contractual obligations for handling private data .
available in : enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions .
available in developer edition at no charge for organizations created in summer ' 15 and later .
salesforce platform encryption sets up in minutes , with no additional hardware or software , and uses native strong , standards - based encryption .
platform encryption provides an extra layer to salesforce 's security while enabling customers to enjoy business critical platform features , such as search , workflow , and validation rules .
311 salesforce summer ’15 release notes comply with data protection requirements using platform encryption ( generally available ) you can : • encrypt files and attachments . •
encrypt certain standard and custom fields .
• use an advanced key management system .
with platform encryption , sensitive field data is masked to limit who can see information .
controls help to protect your data .
these controls include the use of derived data encryption keys and customer - controlled key rotation , generation , and destruction processes .
platform encryption process flow the encryption process follows these steps : 1 .
data is sent to the application server . 2 .
the application server checks if the data encryption key exists in memory . 3 .
one of the following occurs : a. b. if the data encryption key is found in the cache , the application server retrieves it .
if the data encryption key is not found , the application server reads the organization 's encrypted active tenant secret from the database .
the application server then requests a key from the key derivation server with accompanying information such as the encrypted tenant secret and release version .
the key derivation server derives the key in the hsm using the master secret and the tenant secret and provides it to the application server .
4 .

this option enforces the ip addresses in login ip ranges for all salesforce access requests , including logins from client applications .
if this option is not selected , login ip ranges are enforced only when users log in .
editions available in all editions user permissions to set session security : • “ customize application ” track geographic location of user logins you can now track the geographic location of the ip addresses of user logins from the login history or session management pages , or by querying the logingeo object .
when a user attempts to log in to salesforce , geographic information about the login attempt is captured in the logingeo object .
due to the nature of geolocation technology , the accuracy of geolocation fields ( for example , country , city , postal code ) may vary .
for details about the logingeo object , see new objects . editions available in all editions 314
salesforce summer ’15 release notes track authentication service by id with login history track authentication service by id with login history the authentication service id is now associated with a user ’s login history .
for example , this addition allows developers to create reports that track the saml or authentication provider configuration for a login event .
this value is included as a field in the loginhistory standard object .
for more information , see changed objects . editions available in all editions user permissions to set session security : • “ customize application ” simplified oauth flows for external data sources and named credentials previously , oauth flows for external data sources and named credentials sometimes required users to click allow on two consent screens —
one for the external system and one for salesforce .
the salesforce consent screen no longer appears , simplifying the authentication process .
editions now the behavior is as follows .
during the oauth flow , the external system prompts the user to log in .
some external systems require the user to click allow on a consent screen .
then the user returns to the salesforce organization , unless the external system redirects the user elsewhere upon login .
external data sources that use the salesforce adapter for lightning connect have a slightly longer oauth flow .
the same browser session is used to log in to the external system , which in this case is another salesforce organization .
after successfully logging in to that provider organization , the user is prompted to log out and log back in to the original subscriber organization .
see the salesforce help for details about the salesforce adapter for lightning connect .
named credentials are available in : all editions .
lightning connect external data sources are available in : developer edition and for an extra cost in : enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions .

log in once for concurrent apps
that use openid connect after users log in and authorize an application to access their salesforce user data , they are n’t prompted to log in again when they authorize other applications .
this behavior applies to single sign - on using openid connect ( or oauth , if a user logs in to another salesforce app ) .
editions available in all editions there are times when users must log in again , such as when : •
the other application explicitly requires a login •
the other application is configured to bypass ip restrictions •
the user ’s session times out even if users do n’t need to log in again , they are still prompted to allow an application to access their data .
for example , a user visits an application and is prompted to log in to salesforce to authorize access to their salesforce user information .
after the user authorizes the application , the user visits another third - party application that requires access to their salesforce data .
the user is n’t prompted to log in to salesforce again , but the user still allows or denies access to their data .

editions connected apps can be created in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions connected apps can be installed in : all editions 319 salesforce summer ’15 release notes user provisioning for connected apps ( generally available ) automatically create , update , and delete user accounts on services , such as google and box , based on changes to user accounts in your salesforce organization or active directory service .
this feature dramatically reduces the time required to on - board new users , update user accounts , or deactivate accounts .
it also provides a centralized view of all user accounts across applications and services .
user provisioning for connected apps captures user events ( such as creating a user , assigning a permission set or profile , or changing user information ) in a salesforce organization and applies updates to the corresponding account on a third - party service .
for example , you can configure user provisioning for a google apps connected app in your organization .
then assign the profile “ employees ” to that connected app .
when a new user is created in your organization and assigned the “ employees ” profile , the user is automatically provisioned in google apps .
additionally , when the user is deactivated , or the profile assignment changes , the user is automatically de - provisioned from google apps . you can also configure an approval process to request a manager ’s approval before a provisioning or de - provisioning action .
add salesforce identity connect to capture events in an active directory installation and apply user provisioning updates to an external application .
identity connect is an on - premise add - on that provides active directory integration with salesforce .
it synchronizes active directory with your salesforce user accounts .
user provisioning for connected apps can capture active directory changes through identity connect to provision or de - provision users on a third - party system or application .
user provisioning for connected apps benefits a wizard for quick configuration run the user provisioning wizard to configure user provisioning .
support for approval processes include an approval process to give management control over new user accounts and user account changes .
stronger security automatically disable user accounts in third - party applications when a user leaves the company .
auditing and compliance discover and manage the apps your users use .
you can get a centralized view of all the accounts a user has across all connected apps .
run reports and set up alerts . it efficiency reduce maintenance time on user accounts and save time provisioning users for applications .
customization apex and visual workflow support for full customization . 320 salesforce summer ’15 release notes connected app improvements for finer control and easier administration user provisioning for connected apps requirements a connected app for the third - party service
any connected app can support user provisioning , including a “
bookmark ” connected app .
named credentials named credentials identify the third - party system and its authentication settings .
calls to the third - party system , such as creating , editing , or deleting accounts , use the third - party authentication settings in the named credential .
for the named credential , you specify a named principal , which can be an account on the third - party system or an oauth authorization for an existing auth . provider in your organization .
the user provisioning wizard asks for this named credential .
a flow created with the flow designer flows manage provisioning requests to the third - party system .
salesforce provides a connectors package on the appexchange containing pre - configured flows to simplify your user provisioning setup process .
you associate one of these flows with the connected app using the user provisioning wizard .
for more information , see user provisioning for connected apps in the online help .
connected app improvements for finer control and easier administration salesforce introduces several changes to the administration of connected apps for quick adjustments to a connected app ’s configuration .
editions the following changes improve the administration and usability of connected apps .
session timeout for oauth connected apps set a timeout value for individual oauth connected apps when you edit the connected app settings .
the timeout value sets the expiration of the access tokens for the connected app 's session .
if you do n’t set a timeout value or none  is selected ( the default ) , salesforce uses the timeout value in the user ’s profile .
if the profile has no value set , salesforce uses the timeout value in the organization ’s session settings .
edit user provisioning for connected apps account linkage settings on the user ’s detail page or connected app detail page connected apps can be created in : group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions connected apps can be installed in : all editions user provisioning for connected apps links a salesforce user account with their account on a third party system , such as google apps .
once linked , you can edit the account link settings in two places : • ( new ) the user ’s detail page in the user provisioning accounts section .
from setup , click manage users > users . •
the connected app detail page .
from setup , click manage apps > connected apps and click the connected app name .
get a delegated approver using scim ( system for cross - domain identity management ) developers can use the rest api to get the id and display name of the assigned approver for an approval process from salesforce .
editions salesforce supports the open - standard scim specification 1.1 and provides extensions so that you can edit and manage user properties using the rest api .
when a developer requests identity information from a salesforce scim endpoint , salesforce returns the data in json format .
available in all editions the returned values now include the delegated approver ’s id and display name under the uniform resource name ( urn ) : urn : scim : schemas : extension : enterprise:1.0 .
for more information , see “

this change means you can receive notification that your new domain propagation is complete sooner than in previous releases .
before you can log in and test your new domain , salesforce propagates the new name to its servers .
previously , salesforce checked the status of the dns propagation every 10 minutes .
salesforce now checks on the status of the propagation every 30 seconds , possibly decreasing your wait time for notification that the process is complete .
dns propagation is not the same as deploying the domain to your users .
deploying your custom domain is a separate process .
for more information , see my domain overview .
editions available in : • performance • unlimited • enterprise • developer • professional • group test your my domain login page settings
before you deploy the domain to all users previously , you deployed a new domain to your users to test the login settings .
now , you can set up a new domain and test the login page settings without deploying the domain to all users .
editions customize the appearance of the login page before deploying a new custom domain to your users .
test the login page and confirm the authentication services .
you can then roll out the configuration with your initial deployment to your users .
