the translation workbench lets you specify languages you want to translate , assign translators to languages , create translations for customizations you ’ve made to your salesforce organization , and override labels and translations from managed packages .
everything from custom picklist values to custom fields can be translated so your global users can use all of salesforce in their language .
the second option is to rename tabs and fields in salesforce .
if your custom application uses only a few standard salesforce tabs and fields , you can translate them .
fully supported languages you can change the language for all features , including help , to one of the following fully supported languages from the setup page .
enter company information in the quick find box , select company information , then select edit . •
chinese ( simplified ) : zh_cn • chinese ( traditional ) : zh_tw • danish : da • dutch : nl_nl • english : en_us • finnish : fi • french : fr • german : de • italian : it • japanese : ja • korean : ko • norwegian : no • portuguese ( brazil ) : pt_br • russian : ru • spanish : es • spanish ( mexico ) : es_mx • swedish : sv • thai : th note : • spanish ( mexico ) falls back to spanish for customer - defined translations . •
even though the salesforce user interface is fully translated to thai , help remains in english .
end - user languages end - user languages are useful if you have a multilingual organization or partners who speak languages other than your company ’s default language .
for end - user languages , salesforce provides translated labels for all standard objects and pages , except administrative pages , setup , and help .
when you specify an end - user language , labels and help that are n’t translated appear in english .

filter operators reference the operator in a filter is like the verb in a sentence .
operators specify how filter criteria relate to one another .
refer to this list of filter operators while setting filters on list views , reports , dashboards , and some custom fields .
operator uses equals use for an exact match .
for example , “
created equals today . ”
less than use for results that are less than the value you enter .
for example , “
quota less than 20000 ” returns records where the quota field ranges from 0 to 19,999.99 .
greater than use when you want results that exceed the value you enter ; for example , “
quota greater than 20000 ”
returns records where the quota amount begins at 20,000.01 .
less or equal use for results that match or are less than the value you enter .
greater or equal use for results that match or exceed the value you enter . not equal to shows results that do n’t have the value you enter .
this operator is especially useful for eliminating empty fields .
for example , “ email not equal to < blank>. ” contains use for fields that include your search string , but sometimes also include other information .
for example , “ account contains california ” would find california travel , california pro shop , and surf california .
keep in mind that if you enter a short search string , it can match a longer word .
for example , “ account contains pro ” would find california pro shop and promotions corporation .
this operator is not case - sensitive .
does not contain eliminates records that do n’t contain the value you enter .
for example , “ mailing address line 2 does not contain p. o. box . ”
note : when specifying filter criteria on roll - up summary fields , does not contain uses “ or ”
logic on comma - separated values .
on list views , reports , and dashboards , does not contain uses “ and ” logic .
this operator is not case - sensitive
. starts with use when you know what your value starts with , but not the exact text .
this operator is a narrower search term than “ contains . ”
for example , if you enter “
account starts with california , ” you find california travel and california pro shop , but not surf california .
includes available when you choose a multi - select picklist as the selected field .
use this operator to find records that include one or more of the values you enter .
for example , if you enter “
interests includes hockey , football , baseball , ” you find records that have only hockey selected , and records that have two or three of the values entered .
results do not include partial matches of values .
excludes available when you choose a multi - select picklist as the selected field .
use this operator to find records that do not contain any values that match the ones entered .
for example , if you enter “
interests exclude wine , golf , ” your report lists records that contain any other values from that picklist , including values that are blank .
results do not include partial matches of values .
117
get started with salesforce organize your data
operator uses between available for dashboard filters only .
use to filter on ranges of values .
for each range , the filter returns results that are greater than or equal to the minimum value and less than the maximum value .
for example , if you enter “ number of employees from 100 through 500 , ”
your results include accounts with 100 employees up to those with 499 employees .
accounts with 500 employees are n’t included in the results . within available when you create list views based on a geolocation custom field .
shows results that are within the specified radius from a fixed latitude and longitude .
for example , if you enter “ warehouse location within 50 miles 37.775° –122.418° , ” , your list view includes all warehouses within a 50–mile radius of san francisco , california .
