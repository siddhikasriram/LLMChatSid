api access change for connected apps with the current release , all users of approved connected apps must have the “
api enabled ” profile permission turned on to allow access to all features .
in winter ‘ 14 we introduced a program that allows specific approved , security - reviewed connected apps from salesforce and our partners to integrate with salesforce using a process that lets the connected app establish an api connection regardless of user profile settings .
to ensure your users’ access to data is consistent with the permissions you have enabled , these apps will be required to respect user profile permissions for api access .
with this change , users who do n’t have the “
api enabled ” profile permission turned on will no longer be able to use the affected connected apps .
the list of affected connected apps from salesforce includes : • salesforce1 downloadable apps for ios and android devices • salesforce for outlook • connect for outlook • connect for office 34 general enhancements new look and feel for documentation pdf files this change affects all salesforce , chatter , and communities users .
for the complete list of affected apps and expected changes in app behavior for different types of users , see the api access change for connected apps knowledge article .
if you want your users to continue to have access to the affected connected apps , turn on the “ api enabled ” permission .
you can accomplish this through either a profile update or an appropriate permission set .
keep in mind that this will grant users api access to your organization and its data .
if you decide not to grant access , you should notify end users who do not have the “
api enabled ” profile permission that they will not be able to use the affected connected apps .
if you are using an affected connected app developed by a salesforce partner or isv , you should contact the app provider for details on the potential impact .
a list of affected partner connected apps is available in the api access change for connected apps knowledge article .
your data is protected by security tools in the application , including org - wide sharing settings , object - level security , and field - level security .
this applies regardless of how users are accessing data , whether through the api or an application , to ensure that users do n’t have improper access to data .

analytics cloud gives you a fast , fluid way to drill through it , discover compelling insights , and share the right visuals to tell your data story .
datasets , lenses , dashboards , and apps are collections of data that represent different levels of refinement — everything from raw data uploaded from your source systems to highly curated , packaged views of your data . •
a dataset is a set of source data , specially formatted and optimized for interactive exploration .
it can be salesforce data , external data , or a combination , such as a mashup of account data and product usage data . •
a lens is a particular view into a dataset .
it ’s where you explore using interactive visualizations .
a visualization is commonly a chart or graph , such as a bar chart , donut chart , timeline , or heatmap .
it can also be data in tabular form , such as a comparison table or pivot table .
every visualization has an underlying query , which is how analytics cloud retrieves information from the source data . •
a dashboard is a curated set of charts , metrics , and tables based on the data in one or more lenses .
dashboards are interactive .
you can tap on charts , buttons , and other elements to dynamically filter and drill into data .

introducing wave , the analytics cloud explore with powerful visualization tools you read a salesforce analytics dashboard interactively , by clicking the widgets displayed .
every widget is a live , filtered database query . •
a selector is a dropdown list that lets you filter down to a particular value that matters to you .
selectors are often tied to each other in sequence so you can progressively drill deeper . •
a rich variety of charts shows you data from multiple angles .
many parts of a chart are interactive .
for example , click a bar in a bar chart and watch what happens . •
some information is best presented by a single number .
some number widgets can be affected by filtering actions you take on charts or selectors . •
a range widget is a controller for filtering other widgets on the dashboard .
in this example , you can set the maximum and minimum sliders to make the dashboard show you only amounts within a specific range .
explore with powerful visualization tools get to know the boundaries and shape of your data .
use explorer ’s interactive visualization tools to play with different views , zoom in and zoom out , and see what you get with different charting options .
choose from a selection of rich , colorful visualizations to see which views of your data tell the most compelling story .
45 introducing wave , the analytics cloud build powerful queries using saql ( pilot )
every visualization in analytics cloud is based on at least one measure , which is anything that can be represented by a number .
measures are typically aggregated in some way .
for example , you can chart two measures side - by - side , showing both the sum of a revenue amount and the average of expected revenue .
measures define the type and scope of your visualization as you explore a dataset .
visualizations often involve dimensions in addition to measures .
a dimension is anything qualitative that ’s not represented by a number , such as company name , region , and product .
dimensions are handy for grouping your data into useful categories , such as viewing revenue numbers by stage name .
they ’re also handy for filtering unnecessary data out of a visualization , to unclutter your chart and narrow your focus to what ’s most relevant .
exploring your data can lead you down many paths .
not all of them will be fruitful and that ’s okay .
explorer keeps a full history of your activity in a lens .
if you ’ve changed your lens in undesired ways , use history to quickly backtrack to a previous state in your visualization .
share your visualizations with other analytics cloud users .
• give colleagues access to a specific dashboard , lens , or app via a unique url .
• share the app itself , with users , groups , or roles .
• post to chatter the link to a dashboard , lens , or app . •
save a visualization as an image file .

saql is a real - time query language that enables ad hoc analysis of data that ’s stored in datasets .

analytics cloud uses saql behind the scenes in lenses , dashboards , and explorer to gather data for visualizations . 46 introducing wave , the analytics cloud

60 mobile salesforce1 enhancements view and search data that ’s stored outside salesforce salesforce1 users can view and search records that are stored in external systems with lightning connect , so they can seamlessly interact with all relevant data .
this feature is available in the salesforce1 mobile browser app and version 6.0 or later of the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios devices .
for example , some of your data may be in an enterprise resource planning ( erp ) system .
salesforce represents that data in external objects and accesses the data in real time via web service callouts to the external data source .
external objects are read only both in salesforce1 and in the full salesforce site .
editions lightning connect is available in : developer edition and for an additional cost in : enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions as long as the following conditions are true , external objects are automatically included in the recent section of the salesforce1 navigation menu as part of the smart search items element .
users may need to tap more to see these items .
in addition , when these conditions are true , related lists for external objects appear in salesforce1 when users view the parents of those external objects . •
as with custom objects , the external objects must be deployed and assigned to tabs that the users can access , and object permissions must be granted via profiles or permission sets . •
the external objects ' associated external data sources must have the high data volume  checkbox deselected . •
for the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios devices , the external data sources must have the include in salesforce searches  checkbox selected .
to find these checkboxes , from setup in the full salesforce site , click develop > external data sources , then click the name of the external data source .
for more information about lightning connect , see access external data with lightning connect on page 206 .
sort list views locate data in list views faster by controlling how information is sorted and displayed .
this option is now available in the salesforce1 downloadable app for android , versions 7.0 and later .
sorting has been available in the mobile browser app since the summer ’14 release and in the downloadable app for ios as of version 6.0—but in both of these cases , the sort icon is now located in the action bar .
on a list view , tap between sorting in an ascending and descending order .
tap apply to sort the list view . to see the sort options .
tap the column name by which to sort .
tap the column name again to alternate 61 mobile salesforce1 enhancements filter list views to see just what ’s needed salesforce1 users can filter existing list views to see just the records they need , instead of cluttering up salesforce with even more list views .
this option is available in the salesforce1 mobile browser app and the salesforce1 downloadable apps , versions 7.0 and later .
salesforce1 list view filters let a user fine - tune the data that ’s displayed in a list view without affecting how the list view appears to other people in the organization .
while viewing a list view , tap .
the filter page shows any existing filters , which can be cleared if the user wants to start over .
to add a new filter , tap selected field and tap apply to filter the list view . , select the field by which to filter , and tap apply .
then enter the filter criteria for the 62 mobile salesforce1 enhancements the way to enter filter criteria varies , depending on the type of field . •
for text fields , enter the first few characters that match the records to display .
for example , to see accounts whose names start with `` a,’’ create an account name filter on an accounts list view and type a  in the field . •
for date fields , set a start date and an end date to specify a date range .
only results within those dates will appear in the list view . •
for number fields , enter a minimum and maximum value .
only results in that range will appear in the list view .
for example , to see only accounts with a certain number of employees , create an employees filter on an accounts list view , and enter numbers to create the desired range .
63 mobile salesforce1 enhancements note :
it ’s possible to accidentally create a filter that displays no results if the filter criteria is inconsistent with the list view ’s parameters .
for example , creating a filter that shows only opportunities between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 for a list view that displays opportunities over $ 20,000 returns no results .
if a filter has no results , the user should check to see if the filter is screening out all results .
add lightning components to the navigation menu in salesforce1 the lightning component framework powers salesforce1 .
you can use it to create your own lightning components and make them available to salesforce1 users .
from setup , click create > tabs to create a lightning component tab .

adding lightning components to salesforce1 ” in the salesforce help .
for more information on lightning components , see lightning components ( beta ) on page 288 .
open most salesforce urls directly in the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios devices when users of the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios tap a salesforce url hyperlink , or enter a salesforce url into a browser address bar on a mobile device , they ’re taken directly into the salesforce1 app .
this saves users time from having to manually navigate to desired information in the app .
for example , a user can send a salesforce url for an account to some coworkers .
simply by tapping the salesforce url , a coworker using the salesforce1 downloadable app on an ios device can automatically open the account record in the mobile app .
do most actions from the salesforce1 action bar
now , users of the salesforce1 downloadable apps , version 7.0 or later , as well as salesforce1 mobile browser app users , have a one - stop place to find actions so there ’s no more confusion about where to go to do something .
we ’ve consolidated actions from different places in salesforce1 into a new home : the action bar .
record actions ( 1 ) , standard and custom record buttons ( 2 ) , and actions from the publisher ( 3 ) are now located in the action bar ( 4 ) or in the action been redesigned . menu ( 5 ) , which displays all actions that are available on a given page .
the images displayed on action icons have
64 mobile salesforce1 enhancements salesforce1 actions have moved from various locations to the action bar and action menu the action bar is present on the feed , groups , user profiles , dashboards , and standard and custom object record views .
the actions that are available depend on where a user is in salesforce1 , and to some extent on how you ’ve configured page layouts and publisher layouts for your organization .
users may see some or all of these kinds of actions in the action bar ( including the action menu ) . • record actions —
these actions are available on accounts , contacts , leads , opportunities , person accounts , and mobile calendar events in salesforce today .
they ’ve moved from the highlights area to fixed positions in the action bar .
• custom and standard buttons — buttons ( such as edit , delete , or clone ) that are included on an object ’s page layout are available for records in salesforce1 as actions in the action bar .
with the exception of the edit button , which is in a fixed position , the order of these actions in the action bar is determined by the order of the buttons on the page layout . • publisher actions —
these actions have moved from the publisher action tray to the action bar .
if you add , remove , or reorder actions in either the global publisher layout or on an object ’s page layout , these changes are reflected in salesforce1 .
however , depending on the object , some publisher actions are in a fixed position in the action bar .
• standard chatter publisher actions —
actions unique to chatter , such as post , file , link , or poll , have also moved from the publisher action tray to the action bar .
for some objects , the post action is in a fixed position that overrides your publisher layouts .
for more information about which actions are displayed , and in which order , see how actions are ordered in the salesforce1 action bar and list item actions on page 67 .
what are the exceptions ? •
on record feeds , the follow / unfollow button remains at the top of the page .
•
on public group feeds , the join group button remains at the top of the page , but the leave group button is in the action bar .
on private group feeds , the ask to join / leave group buttons are in the action bar . •
on record search pages for objects , the new button remains at the top of the page .
what does this mean for custom branding ? ) does n’t exist anymore in the mobile browser app or in version 7.0 or later of the downloadable apps , it ’s no because the publisher ( longer applicable to configure a custom publisher icon for these apps .
however , if you set a custom background color for salesforce1 , the action bar displays that color .
65 mobile salesforce1 enhancements note :  the publisher icon is still available in versions 5.x and 6.x of the downloadable apps and it ’s still possible to customize the image that ’s used for the icon in these earlier apps .
there can be only one version of a custom icon .
custom action icons you created prior to winter ’15 are still supported , but they will look truncated in the action bar .
to optimize your custom action icons for display in the action bar , use these guidelines . •
the icon should be 72 x 72 pixels .
use the full pixel area for the image —
don’t leave spacing around the image like before .
• make the image a png with a transparent background , with a file size that is less than 10k . •
have a resolution of 72 dpi . •
the icon graphic should be white , or lighter than the background color . •
avoid heavy inner or outer shadows .
• use simple and flat styling resembling the salesforce1 icon family .
work with records directly from lists salesforce1 users can now update records without having to open them .
this huge time - saver comes in the form of list item actions — a version of the action bar that ’s available for items in list views , task lists , and related record lists .
to access list item actions , navigate to a list view or task list or open a related list from an object ’s related information page .
then swipe left on the desired record .
for example , here ’s how it works for the opportunities related list on an account .
here ’s the opportunities related list on an account .
swipe a list item to the left to reveal list item actions .
tap to show the action menu , with the full list of actions available for the list item .
hide list item actions by swiping the list item back to the right or by tapping another item in the list .
66
mobile salesforce1 enhancements list item actions show the same actions that are available in the action bar when viewing the actual record .
in other words , using the example above , a user sees the same set of actions , in the same order , in the list item actions ( and action menu ) for the edge emergency generator list item and in the action bar ( and action menu ) after navigating to the edge emergency generator opportunity record .
same as with the salesforce1 action bar , some list item actions are fixed in their positions , while some actions respect the ordering you ’ve established for standard and custom buttons on page layouts and publisher actions in the global publisher layout and on object page layouts .
for a complete breakdown of the order of actions , see how actions are ordered in the salesforce1 action bar and list item actions on page 67 .
how
actions are ordered in the salesforce1 action bar and list item actions the order in which actions appear in the salesforce1 action bar and list item actions is partly controlled by your organization ’s page layouts and publisher layouts .
but in some cases , the location of key actions is predefined by salesforce to make these actions easily accessible .
the actions in the action bar , list item actions , and associated action menus are divided up into groups .
the arrangement of these groups is fixed , but the order of actions within the groups can vary based on the object and the actions that are present on the global publisher layout or on an object ’s page layout .
action group 1 action group 2 action group 3 action group 4 action group 5 action group 6 table 1 : action groups and the order they display in set of actions predefined by salesforce .

as we mentioned , some actions are in fixed positions .
in places where you see a numbered list in the table , this is the fixed order that those actions appear in on the action bar , list item actions , and in the respective action menus .
for example , for the account object , the standard chatter post action is fixed in the fourth position .
regardless of where you put the post action in the publisher actions section of the account page layout , post always displays in the fourth position when viewing accounts in salesforce1 .
however , deletion of actions is always respected .
so in our example , if you delete the post action from the account page layout , the remaining actions move up and you see edit in the fourth position .

editions data.com
duplicate management available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions by default , duplicate rules run when users save records .

see salesforce events in a weekly view viewing salesforce events in salesforce1 has gotten easier .
events are now available in a weekly view , allowing users to see an event list for a specific day — including previous days — instead of having to scroll through a single list of all events .

users can create new events ( 3 ) and quickly return to the events list for the current day ( 4 ) .
notes about salesforce events in salesforce1 : • as in the summer ’14 release , events lists use the active event compact layout to determine the fields that are displayed for each event .
but because events lists are now shown on a day - by - day basis and to make the lists easier to read , each event no longer includes its date or the event icon .
•
lists now show a maximum of 20 events per day . •
lists do n’t automatically refresh to show new or edited events .
pulling down on a list refreshes the events for the current day only .
the list does automatically refresh if an event is deleted from salesforce1 . •
the icon launches the first create action for events that is in your organization ’s global publisher layout .
this allows you to override the default new event action , if desired .
manage the day
effectively with more key information in salesforce today to ensure that salesforce
today is the one - stop place where sales reps can manage their day , we ’ve redesigned the main today view to include more key information instead of forcing users to navigate around salesforce1 to find what they need .
in addition to mobile calendar events , users can also see important tasks and recently accessed salesforce records .
no longer just an event list , the main today view now shows these cards , in this fixed order : • current event ( 1 ) • agenda ( 2 ) • my tasks ( 3 ) •
my recent records ( 4 ) 81 mobile salesforce1 enhancements users can still tap current and future mobile calendar events to see details , including invitees with matching salesforce contacts and accounts , and to access the conference call dialer , quick message , and log this event actions .
and now users can just as easily tap to manage tasks and other relevant salesforce records .
current event card • this card puts the focus on the user ’s current or next meeting , highlighting key details like the starting time , duration , location , and number of invitees . •
a current event is one that starts 15 minutes before and up to 15 minutes after the current time .
if there are multiple meetings scheduled in this window , each one is displayed in a separate current event card . •
if there are n’t any events in the current time window , the current event card shows the next event scheduled for the day .
• all - day events and multi - day events that have already started are n’t displayed in this card .
agenda card • as the day progresses , this card evolves to show upcoming events or earlier events so users can prepare for what is most relevant at the moment .
users can toggle the card to show all mobile calendar events scheduled for the day . •
the later today state shows all upcoming events for the day .
this state applies when at least one event has concluded and there are other upcoming events .
the more link expands the card to show the complete list of events for the day . •
the earlier today state shows all of the concluded events for the day .
this state appears when all events are finished or the last event of the day is displaying in the current event card . •
the agenda state appears if the only event for the day is an all - day event or a multi - day event that ’s in progress .
( today indicates in - progress multi - day events by showing “
starts ” or “ ends ” in connection with the event ’s time . )
• this card does n’t display if there are no events for the day .
my tasks card • this card includes up to three of the user ’s most important tasks that are due on the current day , so it ’s easier to keep activities updated before and after meetings . •
priority tasks show first , followed by other tasks .
in each of these categories , tasks are sorted by creation date in descending order . •
the more link opens the user ’s full task list . •
this card does n’t display if the user does n’t have any tasks due on the current day .
my recent records card • this card gives users a quick way to access recently viewed salesforce records , which may be related to a user ’s meetings for the current day .
accessing these records from today also makes it faster to do quick updates after a meeting or wrap up to - do items at the end of the day . •
the card only shows records for objects that are available in the salesforce1 app and that are supported in a salesforce most recently used ( mru ) items list .
for example , because salesforce files sync records are n’t supported as recently used items , recently viewed files are n’t included in this card . •
the card displays up to three records ; tap more to see the my recent records list of the 15 most recently accessed records .
all of the today cards update every time a user accesses today — either from the navigation menu or when tapping to return to today from the task list , the my recent records list , or an event or other record that was opened from today .
in addition , the current event and agenda cards auto - refresh as the day proceeds .
the pull - to - refresh gesture does n’t work on the today main view .

to see all records , log into the full salesforce site .
important :  when users drill from a dashboard to a report , they may see slightly different data in the report view from what they saw in the dashboard view .
that ’s because the data displayed in a dashboard is from the last dashboard refresh ( the date and time of which are shown in the dashboard header ) , but drilling down to a report actually runs the report , so in that case the user is seeing the most current report data .

for a short period of time in winter ‘ 15 , when users get an email notification about a feed post , tapping the view comment button in the email does n’t direct them to the actual post in the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios .
instead , users are directed to their feed with the what i follow filter selected .
this known issue is temporary and only affects users on the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios .
users on the salesforce1 mobile browser app and salesforce1 downloadable app for android do not see this issue .
we apologize for this known issue , which will resolve soon in upcoming releases of the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios .
salesforce1 differences from the full salesforce site the salesforce1 app does n’t have all of the functionality of the full salesforce site , and in some cases includes features that are n’t available in the full site .
for complete details about the salesforce features that are different in salesforce1 , see “ salesforce1 limits and differences from the full salesforce site ” in the salesforce help .
for features introduced or updated in winter ’15 , there are differences in these areas : • using chatter • finding information • preventing the creation of duplicate records • using salesforce events • converting leads • using dashboards • working in salesforce communities differences in using chatter • when using topics in the salesforce1 mobile browser app , if the list of tagged topics extends to the edge of the mobile display , a more link leads to the full list of topics . •
when using the good access™ secure mobile browser , you ca n’t upload files .
89 mobile salesforce1 differences from the full salesforce site differences in finding information in this release , it ’s not possible to search across multiple objects in global search .
instead , users select an object from the bar beneath the search box to scope the search to that object .
differences in duplicate management ( beta ) •
each possible duplicate is shown on a “ duplicate card . ”
salesforce1 shows a maximum of 15 duplicates , even if there are more . •
a duplicate card displays three fields , which are derived from the search results format defined for the organization , not from the associated matching rule . •
a user can tap a duplicate card to view the possible duplicate record ’s complete details , but that action erases the information the user entered in the new or updated record .
the user must re - enter that information before the record can be saved or additional duplicate cards can be viewed . •
by default , duplicate rules run when users save records .
you can change this setting in salesforce1 so that duplicate rules run as users complete fields on the record .
in the full salesforce site , from setup , just click mobile administration > salesforce1 > settings .
in the duplicate rule settings section , select run duplicate rules when users complete fields .
differences in using salesforce events •
when viewing salesforce events from the events item in the salesforce1 navigation menu , the date bar always begins on sunday and ends on saturday , regardless of your device and salesforce locale settings .
• salesforce events respect the user ’s salesforce time zone settings , not the time zone setting on the user ’s mobile device . •
if a user is viewing the current day ’s event list at 11:59pm , the list does n’t automatically refresh to the next day at midnight . •
users ca n’t add invitees to events or remove them from events .
differences in converting leads • users can select accounts , but ca n’t create them . •
users can create opportunities , but not select existing ones . •
if duplicate management rules identify a contact as a duplicate , the rules prevent the conversion , regardless of the duplicate management settings . •
users ca n’t select lead sources . •
users ca n’t create related tasks during the conversion , but they can create tasks from the contact record . •
users ca n’t automatically notify owners of converted leads .
differences in using dashboards in some situations , data displayed in a dashboard component can get out of sync with data in the report that 's displayed on the same page .
when a dashboard component ’s data does n’t match the report , one of these things is happening : • the dashboard is being refreshed as the configured user or the running user , while a report is always run as the current user . •
the report was refreshed more recently than the dashboard .
a report is refreshed every time a user looks at it ( if the user is n’t offline ) , but a dashboard component is only refreshed when the dashboard it belongs to is refreshed .
the same temporary mismatch can occur in the full site , but there users see reports and dashboard charts on separate pages .
in salesforce1 , users see the report and the dashboard chart on the same page .

editions salesforce ’s original territory management feature lets you grant users access to accounts based on criteria such as postal code , industry , revenue , or a custom field relevant to your business .
territory management 2.0 builds upon the original feature by introducing territory types , territory models , and territory model states .
these components let you create and preview multiple territory structures and strategies before you activate and implement the one that works best .
custom reports help you organize your territory model for optimum coverage , assess territory effectiveness , and modify your model if necessary .
territory management 2.0 builds on a successful pilot and “ goes g.a. ” with several important new features , which you ’ll learn about here .
here ’s how to get it . •
starting with winter ’15 , territory management 2.0 is ready to be enabled by administrators in new salesforce organizations . •

sales managers can track revenue from supporting sales roles with overlay splits forecasts ( generally available ) sales managers can track revenue from sales team members who help close opportunities but are not directly responsible for them .
by tracking this kind of revenue , sales managers can see the contributions of their overlay sales teams .
editions your sales managers may already be using revenue splits to credit team members who are directly responsible for opportunities .
to provide more flexibility in how credits for opportunities are assigned , we ’ve added overlay splits , which help sales managers and other team members allocate credit to overlay sales roles for working on opportunities .
overlay splits can add up to any percentage of the opportunity amount , sometimes exceeding 100% .
for example , a sales team may include sales engineers , product specialists , or partners who help close deals , but are not directly responsible for them .
available in : • performance • unlimited • enterprise
• developer overlay forecasts let sales managers predict revenue from overlay splits .
forecast amounts roll up through the role hierarchy based on the opportunity ’s amount  field and the overlay team member ’s split percentage .
here we can see that sales representative scott owns an opportunity ( 1 ) , which includes a 50% overlay split for sales engineer owen ( 2 ) , who ’s working with scott to close the deal .
for scott , the opportunity amount field will roll into his opportunity revenue forecast .
122 sales sales managers can track revenue from supporting sales roles with overlay splits forecasts ( generally available )
in addition to the opportunity revenue forecast , owen ’s manager can view the overlay splits forecast ( 1 ) where he can see the deal to which owen is contributing , along with all of the other opportunities his sales engineer team is working on .
owen ’s manager can see that owen is receiving a 50% credit ( 2 ) for this deal , which contributes $ 198,000 ( 3 ) to a total of $ 948,000 revenue in his best case forecast ( 4 ) .
if owen ’s manager thinks the deal will ultimately close for a higher amount , he can adjust the best case forecast amount upward .

123 sales give your sales teams added flexibility for predicting revenue with custom field forecasts ( generally available ) give your sales teams
added flexibility for predicting revenue with custom field forecasts ( generally available ) let your sales teams forecast on custom opportunity currency fields that matter to your organization .
that way , sales teams are no longer limited to the standard revenue  and quantity  fields .
now , your sales teams can forecast on custom currency fields on opportunities .
for example , your sales teams might use a custom field such as margin , monthly recurring revenue , annual contract value , or any other currency field that your organization requires .
you can easily set up a forecast based on any of those custom fields , which your sales managers can then view in the forecasts tab like any other forecast .
available in : •
performance • unlimited • enterprise • developer editions if you use opportunity splits with your custom field , your forecast incorporates those splits .
you can use a custom field forecast by itself or in addition to other forecasts , such as an opportunity - revenue forecast based on the opportunity amount  field .
note :  to enable a custom field forecast , you must first enable : • a custom opportunity currency field • opportunity splits • a custom split type for the custom field ( you must enable the split type even if you do n’t intent to use splits with the custom field . )
if the forecast manager or sales rep viewing the forecast does not have access to the custom opportunity field , they can see forecast amounts but they wo n’t be able to see any of the custom field values in the opportunity list .
forecasting on annual contract value - a simple custom field forecast
here we see an example of an opportunity owned by sales rep anna bressan ( 1 ) .
anna ’s organization has a lot of multi - year deals , so they use a custom annual contract value  field ( 2 ) to track the revenue received from the deal each year . 124 sales give your sales teams added flexibility for predicting revenue with custom field forecasts ( generally available ) here we see the forecasts tab for anna ( 1 ) .
the annual contract value  field in all of anna ’s opportunities rolls up into her annual contract value forecast ( 2 ) , which appears in the forecasts tab along with any other forecasts that you set up .
the forecasted amount ( 3 ) is the value of the annual contract value  field that rolls up into anna ’s forecast .
anna ’s acme –
premium support opportunity ( 4 ) appears in the list at the bottom of the page .
note :  to enable a custom field forecast , your administrator also has to enable opportunity splits for the custom field .
however , the opportunity owner automatically receives a 100% split for the field , so if your organization does n’t plan to use splits with the field , the rollup is the same as if there were no splits .
a custom field forecast with opportunity splits if you use opportunity splits on your custom fields , your custom field forecasts roll up those splits .
for example , here we can see that sales representative anna owns an opportunity ( 1 ) , which includes the annual contract value  field ( 2 ) and a custom split on the annual contract value  field for kevin ( 3 ) , a sales engineer responsible for increasing overall annual contract value for the company .
in this case , kevin ’s 25% split will roll up into his annual contract value forecast .
125 sales give your sales teams added flexibility for predicting revenue with custom field forecasts ( generally available ) kevin ’s manager can view the annual contract value forecast ( 1 ) where he can see the deal to which kevin is contributing , along with all of the other opportunities his sales engineer team is working on .
kevin ’s manager can see that kevin is receiving a 25% credit ( 2 ) for all of his opportunities , which contribute to a total of $ 1,026,000 revenue in his best case forecast .
if kevin ’s manager thinks the deal will ultimately close for a higher amount , his manager can adjust the best case forecast amount upward .
when anna ’s manager views his forecast , he can see anna ’s 75% split . 126 sales forecast managers
can now add context to adjustments with adjustment notes forecasts with the expected revenue field if your organization uses the standard expected revenue  field , you can set up a forecast for it as well .
the expected revenue field is useful for opportunities that are likely to produce more or less revenue than indicated in the amount  field .
for complete details about custom opportunity field forecasts , see “ custom opportunity field forecasts overview ” and “ enable custom field forecasts for sales managers ” in the salesforce help .
forecast managers
can now add context to adjustments with adjustment notes forecast managers can now add a brief note along with each adjustment they make to forecast amounts , allowing others to understand the reason for the adjustment .
when your forecast managers make adjustments to their immediate subordinates’ forecast amounts , they can include a note of up to 140 characters with each adjustment to provide information about the nature of or reason for the adjustement .
when a forecast manager includes a note with an adjustment , a blue triangle ( ) appears next to the forecast amount .
each type of forecast you enable maintains its own adjustment data , including notes .
adjustment notes do not appear in reports .

maintaining clean and accurate data is one of the most important things you can do to help your organization get the most out of salesforce , so we ’re excited to introduce data.com duplicate management .
now you can control whether and when you allow users to create duplicate records inside salesforce ; customize the logic that ’s used to identify duplicates ; and create reports on the duplicates you do allow users to save .
note : • due to extremely high demand for participation in the data.com duplicate management closed beta program , we have reached our capacity and are not taking new nominations .
please understand that data.com duplicate management is scheduled to be generally available to all our crm customers with professional edition and higher in the spring ’15 release ( safe harbor applies ) .
based on the current release schedule , this means the feature will be available in production organizations by mid - february , 2015 , and mid - january , 2015 , for sandbox organizations . •
this release contains a beta version of data.com duplicate management that is production quality but has known limitations .
you can provide feedback and suggestions on the salesforce success community .
for information on enabling this feature for your organization , contact salesforce .
editions enterprise available in : • professional • • performance • unlimited • developer after duplicate management is set up , any time a user attempts to save either a new record or an existing record , the duplicate management tools go to work .
first , the record is compared with existing salesforce records to identify possible duplicates ( 1 ) .
the criteria used to compare records and identify the possible duplicates are defined by a matching rule .
next , a list of possible duplicates is returned ( 2 ) .
what happens when the record being saved is identified as a possible duplicate depends on what ’s defined in the duplicate rule ( 3 ) .
for example , the duplicate rule could block users from saving the possible duplicate record or allow them to save it anyway .
both the block and allow options include an alert , which tells users why they ca n’t save the record and what they need to do .
the allow option includes the ability to report on the duplicate records .
128 sales duplicate management ( closed beta ) duplicate management beta limitations • duplicate management is only available for accounts , contacts , and leads .
all other objects , including custom objects and person accounts , are not currently supported .
• matching rules do not work across objects .
for example , a matching rule wo n’t compare contact records to lead records .
• duplicate rules run as described here for records created from their respective tabs and edited directly from the respective record detail page ( either by clicking edit or editing the record inline ) .
any other method of creating or editing records ( including but not limited to lead convert , creating record from the chatter publisher , and adding records to salesforce using data import tools ) will always result in the save being blocked , regardless of the action specified in the duplicate rule , and the user will not see a list of possible duplicates .
• duplicate rules do n’t run when records are created using quick create . •
if your organization does n’t have the “
use apex lead convert ” permission , duplicate rules do n’t run when leads are converted to accounts or contacts .
• duplicate rules created for leads do not compare converted leads ; therefore , converted leads will never be returned as possible duplicates for leads . •
when a person account is converted to a business account ( and the newly created business account matches existing business accounts ) , duplicate rules will always block the save , regardless of the action specified in the duplicate rule . •
you can not manually merge records if there ’s an active duplicate rule that specifies the action on edit as either allow or block . •

if your organization uses data.com and the data.com duplicate preference option is set to allow duplicate records to be added from data.com prospector , duplicate rules will run but always block users from adding the new records , regardless of the action specified in the duplicate rule . •
when a record is restored with the undelete button , duplicate rules do not run . •
for matching rules to work in a sandbox organization , you must deactivate all matching rules ( and any associated duplicate rules ) and then activate them again .
doing so allows the match index to be created . • standard and custom matching rules that use fuzzy matching methods only support latin characters . •
if you ’re using international data , we recommend you use the exact matching method with your matching rules .
for more information about data.com duplicate management , including detailed information about matching rules , see the implementation guide .

if none of the matching rules in the list are what you want , select create new matching rule .
tip :  we recommend you use the standard matching rule because it ’s been carefully designed to return the best possible set of match candidates .
just be sure you ’ve activated it .
if , however , you decide to create a new matching rule , we recommend you first finish creating your duplicate rule .
then create and activate the new matching rule .

you can disable these features for users by clicking setup > desktop administration > outlook configurations > new outlook configuration and deselecting add email .

137 sales let your users control task notifications globally custom lookups do n’t control activity sharing referencing another record using an activity custom lookup does n’t affect users’ access to the activity , because a record referenced by an activity custom lookup is n’t a parent of the activity .
the lookup is simply a reference to another record .
each custom lookup
can reference one type of record , one record type at a time each custom lookup field can reference one type of record , and no two fields can look up to the same type of record .
to reference records of different types , create multiple custom lookup fields .
each custom lookup field supports one activity lookup related list unlike the open activities and activity history related lists , which display activities related to other records through the name  and related to  fields , custom lookup fields combine open and closed activities in the same related list .
custom sorting is n’t supported the related list of activities from a custom lookup is sorted by activitydate descending and lastmodifieddate descending ( that is , starting with the activity farthest in the future and continuing into the past ) .

for each search , see the : – date – id and title of the article that was clicked • see which keywords users are looking for in your knowledge base . •

armed with that information , she could create more articles on that topic , add promoted results to boost the content that should appear , update articles with that keyword , or add a synonym group to link that keyword to the term that content creators have been using to refer to the topic .
next - gen knowledge search gives users more relevant article search results ( generally available ) we ’ve unveiled a major search engine upgrade , bringing you faster , smarter search with results that are more relevant .
if you have enabled salesforce knowledge , you can take advantage of capabilities such as promoted search terms , searches that automatically use the most effective operator , and additional synonym features to enhance the search experience for your agents and customers .
these enhancements were previously available only through a pilot program .
take advantage of these improvements and new search capabilities .
faster indexing it takes less time for records to be searchable after they ’re created or updated . improved alphanumeric search thanks to more efficient handling of punctuation , we ’ve improved search results when you search for specialized strings such as urls , email addresses , and phone numbers .
certain leading or trailing punctuation symbols are now removed if they surround a tokenized string : < > [ ] { } ( ) ! , . ; : " ' .
for example , ( 415 )  is tokenized as 415 .
we remove these symbols from indexed content and from users’ search queries , making it easier for the search engine to recognize when a user is searching for a phone number , for example .
improved tokenization we ’ve significantly improved tokenization .
the search engine breaks down all searchable text into smaller pieces , or tokens , at meaningful boundaries ( spaces , punctuation , and alphanumeric characters ) and stores them in the search index .
proper tokenization is essential for accurate search results in any language , and especially so for east asian languages that are written without spaces between words , such as chinese , japanese , korean , and thai ( cjkt).for details , see users searching in chinese , japanese , korean , and thai find optimized results on page 159 .
in
this section : users searching in chinese , japanese , korean , and thai find optimized results organizations that search in chinese , japanese , korean , and thai ( cjkt ) languages are uniquely affected by the salesforce knowledge search enhancements .
besides tokenization , we ’ve enhanced punctuation handling and added support for stemming .
users searching articles get a smart default and / or operator when users do n’t specify an operator in an article search , the search engine will determine the best operator to use .
users are no longer required to enter a search operator to see the most relevant results for their search terms .
search operators ca n’t be defined as synonyms when you define synonyms , you ca n’t use and , or , and and not because they ’re reserved for use as search operators .
improve search effectiveness by enabling synonym matching for trailing wildcards in search terms with synonym matching for searches that include a trailing wildcard , your users get what they need faster when they search in salesforce knowledge articles , questions and answers , ideas and idea comments , and cases and case comments .
158 service next - gen knowledge search gives users more relevant article search results ( generally available ) users searching in chinese , japanese , korean , and thai find optimized results organizations that search in chinese , japanese , korean , and thai ( cjkt ) languages are uniquely affected by the salesforce knowledge search enhancements .
besides tokenization , we ’ve enhanced punctuation handling and added support for stemming .
morphological tokenization a key change is the change from bigram tokenization to morphological tokenization .
previously , when indexing a string of characters , the search engine applied bigram tokenization to segment the string into pairs of characters , known as bigrams .
for example , this string in japanese , 東京都知事 , would be tokenized as four bigrams : 東京 , 京都 , 都知 , and 知事.
in the context of this usage , if a user searched for 京都 , the intent is to find 京都 , not 東京都.
however , 東京都 would be returned in search results .
morphological tokenization properly segments this string , 東京都知事 , into three tokens : 東京 , 都 , and 知事. in this context , all three tokens are meaningful and correct , and 京都 is n’t tokenized .
a search for 京都 returns only 京都 and not 東京都 , as expected .
punctuation handling
previously , punctuation in a string such as きっと、来る would cause this string to be excluded from search results if a user searched for きっと来る. now , this search results in a match .
stemming support stemming , or lemmatization , is improved .
for example , a search for 行く would n’t have previously matched on  行きたい.
similarly , a search for ある would n’t have previously matched on あります. now , these stemmed matches are correctly returned in search results .
katakana - hiragana prolonged sound marks not tokenized when the katakana - hiragana prolonged sound mark , also known as the fullwidth hyphen ( ー ) , appears in content ( for example , コ ンピューター ) , it ’s excluded from indexed content .
it ’s also removed from users’ search queries .
limitation with japanese language users who are querying records that are tokenized as chinese if a record contains at least 300 characters in total and contains kanji only ( no katakana or hiragana ) , the content is tokenized as chinese .
therefore , if a japanese language user searches for this record , it might be excluded from search results . kanji - only records with fewer than 300 characters are tokenized in chinese and japanese .
users searching articles get a smart default and / or operator when users do n’t specify an operator in an article search , the search engine will determine the best operator to use .
users are no longer required to enter a search operator to see the most relevant results for their search terms .
many searches use “ and ” as the default operator .
this means that when you search for multiple terms , all of the terms need to match to generate a result .
matching on all terms tends to produce search results that are more relevant than searches using the “ or ” operator , where matches on any of the search query terms appear in the results .
if the search engine does n’t return any results that match all of the terms , it looks for matches using the “ or ” operator .
with the “ or ”
operator , the search engine boosts documents that contain more terms from the search query , so that they appear higher in the results list .
search operators ca n’t be defined as synonyms when you define synonyms , you ca n’t use and , or , and and not because they ’re reserved for use as search operators .
example :
for example , if you ’re defining synonyms for the term automated network dialing , you ca n’t define the acronym and as a synonym .
159 service search highlights and snippets improve search effectiveness by enabling synonym matching for trailing wildcards in search terms with synonym matching for searches that include a trailing wildcard , your users get what they need faster when they search in salesforce knowledge articles , questions and answers , ideas and idea comments , and cases and case comments .
contact salesforce.com customer support to enable synonym matching for trailing wildcards .
it ’s disabled by default .
synonym matching returns synonymous terms that match terms resulting from wildcard expansion , on any term in the search query that has a trailing wildcard .
example :
for example , if you ’ve defined a synonym group that contains the terms bill and invoice , a search for bill *  returns matches for : • bill • billing ( wildcard expansion ) • invoice ( synonym matching ) the search term in the query must match the entire synonym and not just a part of the text .
for example , a search for bi *  returns results only for : • bill ( wildcard expansion ) • billing ( wildcard expansion ) it does n’t return invoice even though invoice is in the same synonym group as bill , which is returned because of wildcard expansion .
synonym matches are returned only for the exact search term ( not for matches with defined synonyms ) .
search highlights and snippets quickly identify the best article and see how articles match your search terms with relevant text and highlighted search terms in the search results .
search highlights and snippets gives your agents and users context as to why the particular result matched their search query .
to enable search highlights and snippets : 1 .

several new methods are available to help developers and advanced administrators customize a console ’s interaction log and navigation tab .
for more information , see salesforce console api ( integration toolkit ) on page 338 .
articles suggested for cases are more relevant ( beta ) agents and customers can reduce time - to - resolution with one - click access to articles that most closely match the keywords that are used in the case subject and description .
suggested articles are available in the salesforce console for service and your portals when users view and create cases .
the search engine looks for articles with similar content to the case subject and description based on the frequency and distribution of matching search terms .
the search engine also looks for articles that were attached to other cases with the same keywords in the subject and description .
prior to winter ’15 , articles were suggested based on the number of times that they were attached to similar cases only .
this improved suggested articles for a case experience is currently available through a beta program .
to enable , from setup go to customize > knowledge > settings , under knowledge one check suggest articles for cases considering case content ( beta ) .
166 service users get the latest search capabilities users get the latest search capabilities users can find what they need and manage their search results more efficiently with smart search , the most up - to - date version of salesforce search , now included in the salesforce console .
with smart search , agents no longer have to use the search options dialog box to select types of objects to search .
they can also customize how their search results appear by pinning types of records to the top of the list .
for more information about smart search , see “ search for records in a salesforce console ” in the salesforce help .
add the files and case experts tools as salesforce console components make it easy for support agents to attach files to cases and find fellow agents who are knowledgable about specific issues while working with cases in the salesforce console .
these tools were introduced in summer ’14 and were previously available only as sidebar components on feed - based case page layouts .
now you can add them as console components instead so they ’re available to users but do n’t take up space on page layouts .
the files tool lets agents see the files associated with a case , add new files , and download files or attach them to case email messages .
with the case experts tool , agents can quickly find and collaborate with colleagues who are knowledgeable about certain topics so they can resolve customers’ issues more quickly .
for more information on adding salesforce console components , see “
add console components to page layouts ” in the salesforce help .
adding and removing case feed highlights panel from the salesforce console has changed we ’ve updated the look of the case feed highlights panel when the compact feed option is selected and have changed the steps for removing it from page layouts .
previously , deselecting the show in the console option for the highlights panel in layout properties on a page layout removed both the console highlights panel and the case feed highlights panel when users viewed case records in salesforce console tabs or subtabs .
now , when compact feed is enabled , deselecting the show in the console option for the highlights panel in layout properties replaces the console highlights panel with the updated case feed highlights panel on primary tabs .
the case feed highlights panel is still shown on console subtabs .
167 service brand your salesforce console with custom colors ( pilot ) to remove highlights panels altogether from both tabs and subtabs , use the page layout to remove all of the fields from the case feed highlights panel .
note :  we recommend using the highlights panel to show the case subject , which is otherwise not visible in the compact feed layout .
for more information on compact feed , see show agents more case information in less space with compact feed on page 151 .
brand your salesforce console with custom colors ( pilot ) now you can brand your salesforce console by specifying the colors of the header and footer .
you can define the colors of the header and footer in the salesforce console in just a few easy steps .
for details and instructions , see “ define colors in the salesforce console ( pilot ) ” in the salesforce help .
new look and feel for the salesforce console we ’ve added a new look and feel to the console , and made it easier for console users to find and edit information .
updated user interface for the console users can now see a console with a more modern look : 168 service new look and feel for the salesforce console lookup component enhanced to display multiple columns users now have greater flexibility for seeing information in lookup components .
they can see some types of information — such as phone and fax numbers — in multiple columns , based on available space , by dragging lookup components’ borders to widen them .
( users might need to resize their browser windows first . )
that way , users get the information that they need without having to scroll to find it .
other types of information , such as descriptions , are still displayed in a single column .
users can hover over related list items to get details users now have greater flexibility for viewing details about items in the related list component — a component added to a record that lists items that are related to that record .
by hovering , users get the information that they need without having to look for it elsewhere .
for example , users can hover over a case number to display the case ’s details , such as contact name , priority , and status .
they can also click hover links to quickly view and edit the additional information .
users can easily edit fields in the lookup component users can now use inline editing to change field values — such as a contact ’s phone number — in the lookup component .
with inline editing , users can manage information more efficiently .
note :  no asterisk ( * ) appears next to the label of a tab that a user is editing via inline editing .
stacked components autosize vertically users can now find information faster and scroll less in stacked components because they autosize vertically to fit browsers .
this autosize design is n’t available in internet explorer® 7 .
warning message on navigation tab setup administrators setting up a console can now see which items haven’t been fully adapted for a console from messaging and asterisks ( * ) .
users can refresh all primary tabs with visualforce pages users can now click and select refresh all primary tabs to refresh tabs showing visualforce pages without entity ids .

change to prevent self - service portal pages from redirecting to non - salesforce domains to align with our security best practices , the winter ’15 release includes a change that prevents self - service portal pages from redirecting to non - salesforce domains .
this action will eliminate the risk of users unknowingly being diverted to sites by an unauthorized third party .
this update is designed to protect users from potential phishing threats and ensure redirect behavior in the self - service portal is consistent with redirect behavior in the rest of the salesforce platform .
with the winter ’15 release , external redirects in the self - service portal will result in the following error message : “ invalid page redirection : the page you attempted to access has been blocked due to a redirection to an outside website or an improperly coded link or button .
please contact your salesforce.com administrator for assistance . ”
to prevent any disruption to your service , you must review any implemented pages and remove all instances of redirections to non - salesforce pages .
the following url redirection parameters are subject to this new behavior in the self - service portal for external urls : • returl • starturl • cancelurl • saveurl to direct users to an external website from the self - service portal , we recommend the following options : • update your links to point directly to the intended website .
for example , change < a href = " https://na1.salesforce.com/sserv/portal.jsp?returl=http://company.com " > to < a href = " http://company.com">. • use visualforce and apex to recreate the intended process .
for more information on developing redirects , refer to the apex pagereference documentation .

use the report to show where and how users are sharing files in your organization .
see when each link was created , when it expires , when it was last visited , whether it is password protected , and the total number of times the link has been visited .
the report includes links users created using salesforce crm content deliveries and share via link in chatter .
each of the links in this report can be accessed by users outside of your organization .
user permissions to run and view a file report • “ run reports ”
187 chatter users have more options in the file sharing settings menu to run the file and content links report from the reports tab , click file and content reports > file and content links .

see content deliveries in the sharing settings menu the sharing settings menu now shows content deliveries , in addition to shares with people , groups , publicly available links , records in salesforce , and content libraries .
users can easily manage access to the file directly from the sharing settings menu for each type of share .
if users have access to the record or content details page associated with the content delivery , they can click view list under anyone with delivery  to view associated content deliveries .
if users own associated records or content , or have the “
modify all data ” user permission , they can manage associated content deliveries . know who can access files with improved sharing descriptions if user sharing is set to private in your organization , the sharing settings menu better describes who the file is shared with , so users do n’t accidentally share files more widely than they intended .
for example , when fred williamson posts a file to whitney humboldt ’s 188 chatter sync shared files with salesforce files sync feed , the sharing settings menu informs him that whitney humboldt and anyone who can see whitney humboldt can access the file .
users can open the sharing settings menu from the files tab by clicking > sharing settings next to the file they want to share .

this section : enable users to collaborate more privately in unlisted groups give your users a more private option for collaboration in chatter .
unlisted groups offer more privacy compared to private groups , because only members and users with the “ manage unlisted groups ” permission can access unlisted groups in list views , feeds , and search results .
unlisted group limitations consider the limitations of unlisted groups before you decide to enable them in your organization .
189 chatter enable users to collaborate more privately in unlisted groups updated user search in the add / remove group member dialog if you ’ve enabled profile - based rollout of chatter and have more than 500 users in your organization , the everyone list on the add / remove members dialog is n’t populated .

enable users to collaborate more privately in unlisted groups give your users a more private option for collaboration in chatter .
unlisted groups offer more privacy compared to private groups , because only members and users with the “ manage unlisted groups ”
permission can access unlisted groups in list views , feeds , and search results .
user permissions to enable unlisted groups : • “ customize application ”
unlisted groups are similar to private groups in that only members can view an unlisted group ’s feed or files .
however , unlisted groups provide more privacy compared to private groups . •
membership for unlisted groups is by invitation only .
nonmembers ca n’t ask to join them .
• unlisted groups do n’t display in list views , feeds , and search results for nonmembers .
only members and users with the “
manage unlisted groups ” permission can find and access an unlisted group . •
you ca n’t see unlisted groups on a user ’s profile in chatter unless you have access to the group . •
even users with the “
modify all data ” or “
view all data ” permissions ca n’t access an unlisted group unless they ’re members or they have the “
manage unlisted groups ” permission .
• nonmembers ca n’t visit the group detail page .
( with private groups , nonmembers can see a truncated version of the detail page , which shows the name , description , and member list , but not the feed or files . ) • chatter enforces group name uniqueness across public , private , and unlisted groups .
if a user tries to create a group with the same name as an unlisted group , they ’ll see an error message that informs them that a group by the same name exists .
for this reason , we recommend that you do n’t include sensitive information in unlisted group names .
choose names that are difficult to guess or not obvious .
for example , do n’t use an obvious name like acme merger .
note :  before you enable unlisted groups in your organization , review the limitations on page 190 that apply to unlisted groups .
to enable unlisted groups in your organization , in setup , go to chatter > settings and click edit .
select enable unlisted groups and the checkbox next to i want to enable unlisted groups and understand that i may need to update apex / visualforce code in my organization , and then save your changes .
unlisted group limitations consider the limitations of unlisted groups before you decide to enable them in your organization .
for administrators • users with the “
modify all data ” permission can delete feed items from unlisted groups even if those users are just group members . •
users with the “ manage unlisted groups ” permission but not the “
modify
all data ” permission ca n’t delete feed items from unlisted groups . •
users with the “ data export ”
permission can export all chatter data and view the exported posts and comments from any group , regardless of whether the they have the “ manage unlisted groups ” permission .
editions available in : • contact manager • group •
professional • • performance • unlimited • developer enterprise •
you ca n’t grant the “
manage unlisted groups ” permission to users with these profiles chatter external , high volume portal , or high volume customer portal .
190 chatter updated user search in the add / remove group member dialog • unlisted groups count toward a user ’s group limit , but they do n’t appear in the groups list on a user ’s profile page unless the person who ’s viewing the list is a member of those groups or has permission to manage unlisted groups .
when unlisted groups are hidden , the count that ’s shown next to the groups list might not be accurate , depending on the permissions of the person viewing the list .
for developers apex code runs in system mode , which means that the permissions of the current user are n’t taken into account .
this limitation has implications for pages that are written in apex .
• visualforce pages that display groups might expose unlisted groups to users who are n’t members .
• because system mode disregards the user ’s permissions , all users who are accessing a visualforce page that ’s showing an unlisted group can act as an owner of that group .
• appexchange apps that are written in apex and that access all groups will expose unlisted groups to users who are n’t members .
to limit and manage access to the unlisted groups in your organization : • explicitly filter out unlisted groups from soql queries in all apex code . •
use permission sets , profile - level permissions , and sharing checks in your code to further limit unlisted group access .
• use apex triggers on the collaborationgroup object to monitor and manage the creation of unlisted groups .
in setup , go to chatter >
groups > group triggers to add triggers .
updated user search in the add / remove group member dialog if you ’ve enabled profile - based rollout of chatter and have more than 500 users in your organization , the everyone list on the add / remove members dialog is n’t populated .

in salesforce , many features require access checks that specify which users can access certain functions .
permission set and profiles settings include built - in access settings for many entities , such as objects , fields , tabs , and salesforce pages .
however , permission sets and profiles do n’t include access for some custom processes and apps .
for example , for a time - off manager app , all users might need to submit time - off requests , but only a smaller set of users need to approve time - off requests .
you can use custom permissions for these types of controls .
custom permissions let you define access checks that can be assigned to users via permission sets or profiles , similar to how you assign user permissions and other access settings .
for example , you can define access checks in apex that make a button on a visualforce page available only if a user has the appropriate custom permission .
with the winter ’15 release , custom permissions include the following enhancements . •
you can specify required custom permissions for other custom permissions .
a required custom permission is a custom permission that must be enabled when the parent custom permission is enabled .

to connect to an external data source , lightning connect uses the open data protocol ( odata ) version 2.0 .
for example , suppose that you have product order information stored in an external database and you want to view those orders as a related list on each customer record in salesforce .
lightning connect enables you to set up a relationship between the ( parent ) customer object and the ( child ) external object for orders .
then you can set up the page layouts for the parent object to include a related list that displays child records .
for lightning connect setup details and considerations , see the salesforce help .
example :  this screenshot shows how lightning connect can provide a seamless view of data across system boundaries .
a record detail page for the business_partner external object includes two related lists of child objects .
in this example , external lookup relationships and page layouts enable users to view related data from within and from outside salesforce on a single page .

customers who purchase our services should make their purchase decisions based upon features that are currently available .
editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer each connection to your customer drives an ever - increasing scale of data .
this growth demands a new set of tools , and the data pipelines pilot ushers in apache hadoop on the salesforce platform , enabling highly scalable batch processing , transformation , and understanding of customer data .
as apex provides a strongly typed , object - orientated programming language that enables developers to control and execute flow and transaction control , data pipelines offers a complementary tool set for data flow control .
this tool set comes in the form of apache pig , a broadly used and high - level language for expressing data flow control , along with a set of functions to help evaluate data .
pig offers an abstraction on top of the salesforce hadoop infrastructure to permit mapreduce processing within the context of the established salesforce multi - tenant architecture .
data pipelines are expressed as pig latin scripts that are deployed to your organization by using mechanisms that are familiar to the salesforce developer community ( the metadata api and the tooling api ) .
data pipelines supports apache pig 0.13 distribution and apache datafu 1.2.0 , and delivers a whitelisted set of apache datafu and piggybank udf libraries to broaden the computational expressiveness for a comprehensive set of use cases .

this section : visually automate your business processes ( beta ) the process builder is a new workflow tool that helps you easily automate your business processes by providing a powerful and user - friendly visual representation of your process as you build it .
in just a few clicks you can automate business processes and help your organization operate more efficiently . automate time - based processes use the brand - new wait element to automate processes that require a time - based waiting period .
for example , you can create a flow that activates a contract , waits until one day after the contract is activated , and then emails the customer with a feedback form .
store multiple values
together in a flow store multiple values together — so that you can operate on them — by using the new collection variable flow resource .
collection variables can store both manually entered values and values from flow resources , such as email addresses entered in a flow ’s screen .
using collection variables can help you conserve limits by not querying the salesforce database for that information .
submit records for approval from a flow ( generally available ) with the new submit for approval element , you can configure a flow to submit a record for approval — without any code .
previously , to do this in a flow you had to write an apex class and expose it in the cloud flow designer as an apex plug - in .

behavior changed for default values in flow screen fields
previously , flows used the last - entered value for a field on a screen if the screen had been visited before , regardless of whether it was the same instance of that screen .
the “
behavior change for default values in flow screen fields ”
critical update ensures that when a flow is designed to visit a screen multiple times , such as in a loop , the default value is used .
receive email for each unhandled fault
previously , when multiple interviews resulted in unhandled faults whose messages were similar , the flow creator received an email for only the first unhandled fault .
when the “
flow creators receive email for each unhandled fault ” critical update is activated , flow creators receive one email for each unhandled fault that occurs .
that way , you and other flow creators are aware of every fault that occurs in one of your flows .
approval response enhanced delegated approvers can approve or reject email approval requests by replying to those requests .
this feature helps to minimize bottlenecks in the approval process and is especially useful for organizations with users who receive approval requests on mobile devices .

209 force.com customization visually automate your business processes ( beta ) other changes in business logic and process automation learn about other enhancements to visual workflow and workflow .
visually automate your business processes ( beta ) the process builder is a new workflow tool that helps you easily automate your business processes by providing a powerful and user - friendly visual representation of your process as you build it .
in just a few clicks you can automate business processes and help your organization operate more efficiently .
the process builder ’s simple and powerful design allows you to : • create your processes by using a convenient visual layout with point - and - click efficiency . •
create your whole process in one place rather than using multiple workflow rules .
• have multiple colleagues contribute to creating your business processes .
• stop using apex code to automate simple tasks .
automated processes in the process builder consist of criteria that determine when to execute action groups and immediate and time - dependent actions to execute when those criteria are met .
any change that causes a record to match the criteria can automatically trigger the action group .
if you ’re familiar with workflow , you can use the process builder to perform all of the same actions ( with the exception of outbound messages ) , but with more power and flexibility .
without writing a single line of apex code , you can : • create a record .
• update any related record — not just the record or its parent . •
use a quick action ( object - specific or global ) to create a record , update a record , or log a call .
• launch a trigger - ready flow — from immediate and also scheduled actions . •
send an email .
• post to chatter .
•
submit a record for approval .
with the process builder , it ’s easy to get started creating automated business processes .
for example , you can create automated processes that : • update all the mailing addresses on all child contacts when a billing address is changed on an account . •
submit a record for approval without requiring users to click submit .
• create records and notifications based on stages of an opportunity and schedule follow - up tasks that execute based on changes to records .
• create an order record with the data in the opportunity and associated account when the opportunity stage changes to closed and won . •
send an email reminder to the account team if a high - value opportunity is still open ten days before the specified close date .
210 force.com customization automate time - based processes user permissions to open , edit , or create a flow in the cloud flow designer : • “ manage force.com flow ”
automate time - based processes use the brand - new wait element to automate processes that require a time - based waiting period .
for example , you can create a flow that activates a contract , waits until one day after the contract is activated , and then emails the customer with a feedback form .
wait elements are only available in trigger - ready flows , which means you ca n’t have a wait element in the same flow as any screens , choices , or dynamic choices .
after you add a wait element to a flow , configure it by defining the events that you need to wait for .
the available event types are both alarms , which consist of a date / time value and an optional offset from that time .
each event can also have waiting conditions , which determine whether the flow interview should wait for the associated event during runtime .
for more details , see configure a flow to wait for events in the salesforce help .
when a flow interview executes a wait element , it waits for all of the defined events whose waiting conditions are met .
when the first of those events occurs , the interview resumes , still in the context of the user who started the interview originally , and executes the event path for that event .
if you need to execute multiple event paths , configure the flow to return to the wait element .
example :  for example , in a flow that activates a contract , you can wait until one day after the contract is activated and then email the customer with a feedback form .
for details about this and other sample flows that use the wait element , including a flow that executes multiple event paths , see “ sample flows that wait for events ” in the salesforce help .

on the flow list page , the waiting interviews list identifies all flow interviews that are waiting for an event to occur before they proceed .
store multiple values
together in a flow store multiple values together — so that you can operate on them — by using the new collection variable flow resource .
collection variables can store both manually entered values and values from flow resources , such as email addresses entered in a flow ’s screen .
using collection variables can help you conserve limits by not querying the salesforce database for that information .
previously , you could n’t store manually entered values or values from another flow resource .
both sobject variables and sobject collection variables can store multiple values , but they must be field values .
create a collection variable from the resources tab in the cloud flow designer by double - clicking collection variable .
user permissions
to delete flow interviews : • “ manage force.com flow ”
user permissions to open , edit , or create a flow in the cloud flow designer : • “ manage force.com flow ”
unlike with variables , sobject variables , and sobject collection variables , you ca n’t use record lookup or fast lookup elements to populate a collection variable .
to populate a collection variable , add values whose data type matches the collection variable by using an assignment .
in other words , do n’t try to add a variable of type text to a collection variable of type number .
submit records for approval from a flow ( generally available ) with the new submit for approval element , you can configure a flow to submit a record for approval — without any code .

user permissions to open , edit , or create a flow in the cloud flow designer : • “ manage force.com flow ”
in the summer ’14 release , the submit for approval element was available only through a pilot program and you could only specify the record to submit .
after you add a submit for approval element to a flow , use the input parameters to identify which record you want to submit .
you can further customize the element by entering values for optional parameters , such as identifying a specific approval process or who the approval request should be sent to .
for more details about configuring this element , see “
submit a record for approval from a flow ” in the salesforce help .

previously to create a post from a flow , you had to use an apex plug - in or create a feeditem record .
after you add a post to chatter element to a flow , use the input parameters to identify the message that should be posted and the user , chatter group , or record whose feed it should be posted to .
the message can include mentions and topics .

user permissions to open , edit , or create a flow in the cloud flow designer : • “ manage force.com flow ” behavior changed for default values in flow screen fields
previously , flows used the last - entered value for a field on a screen if the screen had been visited before , regardless of whether it was the same instance of that screen .
the “ behavior change for default values in flow screen fields ”
critical update ensures that when a flow is designed to visit a screen multiple times , such as in a loop , the default value is used .
user permissions
there are two ways that an interview —
a running instance of a flow— can visit a flow screen field multiple times . •
the same instance : the user who ’s running the flow enters information into a screen field , clicks previous , and then clicks next . •
different instance : a screen is used within a loop , and the flow requires the fields to be completed independently each time .
to view critical updates : • “ view setup and configuration ”
to activate critical updates : • “ modify all data ” and “ customize application ”
if you activate this update now , flows use the default value ( if you set one ) for the field when visited for the first time for that instance .
if the user reaches the screen because the flow is navigating through a loop , the default value for that field is used .
if the user reaches the screen by navigating back — or by navigating back and then forward — the last - entered value for that field is used .
you can activate this critical update from setup by clicking critical updates and then clicking activate for “ behavior change for default values in flow screen fields . ”
receive email for each unhandled fault
previously , when multiple interviews resulted in unhandled faults whose messages were similar , the flow creator received an email for only the first unhandled fault .
when the “
flow creators receive email for each unhandled fault ” critical update is activated , flow creators receive one email for each unhandled fault that occurs .
that way , you and other flow creators are aware of every fault that occurs in one of your flows .
whenever a flow interview fails , the system generates a fault message .
if there ’s no fault path defined to handle the error gracefully , the error is considered an unhandled fault and the system sends an email that contains the fault message to the flow creator .
we recommend that you activate this update now .
note that you and other flow creators might receive more emails that contain flow fault messages than you are used to receiving .
you can activate this critical update from setup by clicking critical updates and then clicking activate for “ flow creators receive email for each unhandled fault . ” user permissions
to view critical updates : • “ view setup and configuration ”
to activate critical updates : • “ modify all data ” and “ customize application ”
for details about adding fault paths to more gracefully handle these errors , see “

213 force.com customization approval response enhanced approval response enhanced delegated approvers can approve or reject email approval requests by replying to those requests .
this feature helps to minimize bottlenecks in the approval process and is especially useful for organizations with users who receive approval requests on mobile devices .
a delegated approver is a user appointed by an assigned approver as an alternate for approval requests .
when a delegated approver responds to an approval request , the first line of the email body may contain one of the following words : • approve • approved •
yes • reject • rejected • no
periods and exclamation marks are allowed at the end of each word .
delegated approvers can optionally add comments in the second line of the email body .
they can also click a link in the email to access the approval page .
specify a submitter for an approval process you can specify a submitter of a record programmatically using new apex methods that have been added to the processsubmitrequest class .
with this improved flexibility , you can submit records in bulk on behalf of other submitters .
for more information about the apex methods , see new and changed apex classes .
note :  if you use custom email templates with merge fields , you need to account for the possibility that the current user and the submitter are n’t the same user .
for example , you may need to change current user references of { !
user.field_name } to a specified submitter reference { !
approvalrequestinguser.field_name}. other changes in business logic and process automation learn about other enhancements to visual workflow and workflow .
identify recipients more flexibly in the send email element the send email element in visual workflow now has two ways to identify the recipients of the email .
previously , there was one required parameter called email addresses .
that parameter is now email addresses ( comma - separated )  to differentiate it from a second parameter for recipients called email addresses ( collection ) .
both parameters are optional , but you must use at least one of them for the flow to successfully send the email .
between the two parameters , the total number of email addresses must be five or fewer .
the email addresses ( collection )  parameter accepts only collection variables of type text .
see store multiple values together in a flow for details about collection variables .
the email addresses ( comma - separated )  parameter accepts only non - collection string values .
for example , you can reference the value for an input field , a variable of type text , or a comma - separated list of manually entered email addresses .
send email from an organization - wide email address
the send email element in visual workflow now allows you to send emails from an organization - wide email address .
in enabling this functionality , we also added a new sender address  parameter to the send email element .
to send an email from an organization - wide email address : 1 .
for sender type , enter orgwideemailaddress . 2 .
for sender address , enter the value of the verified organization - wide email address .

customize and manage user authentication with login flows login flows allow administrators to build post - authentication processes to match their business practices , associate the flow with a user profile , and send the user through that flow as they log in .
use login flows to collect registration information from users , provide a terms of service acceptance form , prompt the user for a second factor of authentication and other customization .
editions use the flow designer to create login flows , then associate those flows with specific profiles in your organization .
you can connect the same flow to multiple profiles .
users with the profile are directed to the login flow after they authenticate , but before the user is directed to the organization ’s content .
the login flow screens are embedded within the standard salesforce login page for an integrated user login experience .
login flows support all of the salesforce user interface authentication methods , including username and password , delegated authentication , saml single sign - on and social sign - on through a third - party auth
. provider .
login flows can be applied to logins to salesforce organizations , communities and portals .

create a new flow using the flow designer and apex .
for example , you can design a custom ip - based two - factor authentication flow that requires a second factor of authentication only if the user is logging in from outside of the corporate trusted ip range .
( to find or set the trusted ip range , from setup , choose security controls > network access . )
note :  do not set the login ip ranges directly in the user profile .
the login ip ranges set directly in a profile restrict access to the organization for users of that profile who are outside that range , entirely , and those users can not enter the login flow process .
the flow should contain the following .
a. a new apex class defining an apex plugin that implements from the ( process .
plugin ) and uses the auth .
sessionmanagement  class to access the time - based one - time password ( totp ) methods and services .
the new apex class for the plugin generates a time - based key with a quick response ( qr ) code to validate the totp provided by the user against the totp generated by salesforce .
b. a screen element to scan a qr code .
c. a decision element to handle when the token is valid and when the token is invalid .
within the flow , you can set input variables .
if you use the following specified names , these values will be populated for the flow when it starts .
name loginflow_logintype loginflow_ipaddress loginflow_loginipaddress loginflow_useragent loginflow_platform loginflow_application loginflow_community loginflow_sessionlevel loginflow_userid value description the user type , such as chatter community external user the user ’s current ip address the user ’s ip address used during login , which can change after authentication the user agent string provided by the user ’s browser the operating system for the user application used to request authentication current community , if this login flow applies to a community the current session security level , standard or high assurance the user ’s 18-character id .

you can request some basic information , such as username and a photo url , or you can get more specific information , such as an address , phone number , contact list , and more .
the user approves the exchange of information before it is given .
when you set up linkedin as an auth . provider , you can set the scopes in three different places : in the linkedin application settings , in the salesforce auth .
provider settings , or in a query to linkedin ’s user info endpoint using field selectors .
consider the following as you decide where to specify the scopes , and the values to use . •
you can leave this value blank in the linkedin and salesforce settings .
the default value is r_basicprofile , which provides only the most basic user information as defined by linkedin . •
salesforce requires the email address for users . •
refer to the linkedin authentication documentation for a list of supported values and their meaning , or the linkedin field selectors page for information about requesting scopes using a url . •
if you set the default scopes in the salesforce auth .
provider settings , that value overrides the value in the linkedin application settings . •

several client configuration urls are generated after defining the authentication provider : •
test - only initialization url : administrators use this url to ensure the third - party provider is set up correctly .
the administrator opens this url in a browser , signs in to the third party , and is redirected back to salesforce with a map of attributes . •
single sign - on initialization url : use this url to perform single sign - on into salesforce from a third party ( using third - party credentials ) .
the end user opens this url in a browser , and signs in to the third party .
this then either creates a new user for them , or updates an existing user , and then signs them into salesforce as that user . •
existing user linking url : use this url to link existing salesforce users to a third - party account .
the end user opens this url in a browser , signs in to the third party , signs in to salesforce , and approves the link . •
oauth - only initialization url : use this url to obtain oauth access tokens for a third party .
users must authenticate with salesforce for the third - party service to get a token ; this flow does not provide for future single sign - on functionality .
• callback url : use the callback url for the endpoint that the authentication provider calls back to for configuration .
the authentication provider has to redirect to the callback url  with information for each of the above client configuration urls .
the client configuration urls support additional request parameters that enable you to direct users to log into specific sites , obtain customized permissions from the third party , or go to a specific location after authenticating .

editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer security fix protects organization data from guest users a potential security vulnerability related to guest user sessions has been fixed .
previously , some custom force.com community site pages generated guest user session ids .
these guest sessions could lead to anonymous api access via the guest user ’s object , field , and record permissions .
with this fix , custom force.com community site pages do n’t generate or display guest user session ids , and are n’t vulnerable to anonymous access .
custom force.com community site pages that use api version 32.0 are secure .
salesforce ’s built - in pages are also secure .
note :  in api versions 32.0 and later , the apex userinfo.getsessionid ( )  static method returns the string null_session_id .
the visualforce $ api .
session_id  field returns a null  value as the session id for a site ’s guest user .
this is because guest user sessions are disabled , and the guest user context is no longer the default context .
this change affects only api versions 32.0 and later .

other changes in globalization corrections and optimizations were made to a few language and locale features .
inactive multiple - language features removed from single - language organizations some single - language organizations had access to two multiple - language features in setup , but these features were inactive in their organization .
these features have been removed from setup in these organizations to reduce confusion .
241 force.com customization site.com the affected features are , from setup : • company profile > language settings when accessed , administrators received an insufficient privileges error .
this item is no longer displayed . •
customer portal > assigned languages this related list used to allow customers to add languages besides the default language that was chosen when the organization was set up .
added languages would nevertheless be inactive in their customer portal .
the add new language button now only allows administrators to add a single language , and the only allowed language is the organization ’s default language .
adding the default language as an assigned language has no effect on your customer portal .
non - currency locales removed from currency locale lists
in single - currency organizations , when you were choosing a currency locale in setup , it was possible to choose a locale that did n’t have a currency associated with it .
this setting could cause minor unexpected behavior , such as an incorrect currency symbol in front of currency amounts .
locales without currencies are no longer options in these menus .
if your organization was affected by this issue , simply update your organization ’s currency .
in setup , go to company profile > company information , and then click edit .
choose the appropriate currency locale under currency settings , and then save your changes .
there ’s no need for you to do anything else , unless you ’ve written custom code that depends on the specific contents of these menus or list of locales .

flexibility to your page templates with custom properties site.com page templates let designers and site administrators save time by defining the layout and functionality of site pages in a reusable template .
and with the introduction of custom properties , you can now achieve even greater flexibility over how your templates are reused .
when you create a page template , you can add custom properties to it and specify their values in the properties pane .
then , by adding custom code or content blocks to the page template , you can access the property values by using expressions .
expressions serve as placeholders for data that will be replaced with information when the page loads .
in turn , when you or your team create a page from the template , the page is a copy or instance of the template .
because expressions are just placeholders , their values are updated automatically when you update the values in the page ’s properties pane .
242 force.com customization add flexibility to your page templates with custom properties when the page template is open , you add custom properties to it by clicking edit custom properties in the properties pane .
this action opens a new custom properties dialog box , where you can create properties and group them into sections .
but that ’s not all !
to let your team update the template ’s appearance , you can add branding properties to the template by clicking edit branding properties in the properties pane .
when you use expressions in the site ’s style sheet as placeholder styles , your team can use the branding editor to update the branding properties in any template - derived page .
note :  for communities users , custom and branding properties for templates are n’t available when using communities designer ( beta ) with the four available templates .
example :
for example , let ’s say you add a content block to the template to contain the page ’s heading .
in this case , when users create a page from the template , you want to let them replace part of the text to suit their needs , but without letting them edit the entire content block .
by adding a custom property that ’s called pagesubject  and specifying an initial value , you can instead use the following expression in the content block : learn about { ! pagesubject }
this action lets team members rename any page that ’s derived from the template by updating the page subject  property in the page ’s properties pane , which automatically updates the value that ’s represented by the { ! pagesubject }  expression .

critical updates this release includes updates that improve the performance , logic , and usability of salesforce but might affect your existing customizations .
to ensure a smooth transition , each critical update has an opt - in period , which ends on the auto - activation date that ’s displayed on the critical updates page in setup .
during this period , you can manually activate and deactivate the update as often as you need to evaluate the impact on your organization and modify affected customizations .
after the opt - in period has passed , the update is automatically activated .
for more details , see “ critical updates overview ” in the salesforce help .
behavior changed for default values in flow screen fields
previously , flows used the last - entered value for a field on a screen if the screen had been visited before , regardless of whether it was the same instance of that screen .
the “ behavior change for default values in flow screen fields ”
critical update ensures that when a flow is designed to visit a screen multiple times , such as in a loop , the default value is used .
receive email for each unhandled fault user permissions to view critical updates : • “ view setup and configuration ”
to activate critical updates : • “ modify all data ” and “ customize application ”
previously , when multiple interviews resulted in unhandled faults whose messages were similar , the flow creator received an email for only the first unhandled fault .
when the “
flow creators receive email for each unhandled fault ” critical update is activated , flow creators receive one email for each unhandled fault that occurs .
that way , you and other flow creators are aware of every fault that occurs in one of your flows .
serve static resources from the visualforce domain when activated , this update changes the way that your static resources , such as images , javascript , and css files , are served from salesforce .
to avoid broken references to static resources , make sure that you review our recommended best practices .
other changes in force.com even small customization enhancements can make salesforce easier to use .
user interface change to enabling state and country picklists the user interface for enabling state and country picklists has been revised slightly .
clicking enable immediately shows a message confirming that state and country picklists are in the process of being enabled , rather than waiting for the enabling process to complete .
this fixes a rare situation where the request could time out before the enabling process finished .

with this option , you do n’t have to cancel apex jobs to be able to have a successful deployment .
deploy your components in less time ( pilot ) you can now deploy components to production by skipping the execution of all apex tests for components that have been validated within the last four days .
with quick deploy , you no longer have to wait for all tests to run for your deployment to complete in production , and your deployment will likely finish in less than 30 minutes .
deploy with active jobs an option has been added to the deployment settings page that lets you deploy components referenced by active apex jobs .
with this option , you do n’t have to cancel apex jobs to be able to have a successful deployment .
previously , deployments failed if they contained components that were referenced by apex jobs that were pending or in progress .
for example , if you deploy an apex class that implements schedulable , and there is a scheduled job that corresponds to this class , this class ca n’t be deployed , and the entire deployment fails .
you can now enable the deployment of components with corresponding jobs — including scheduled jobs , batch jobs , and future methods — and avoid deployment failure .
to do so , from setup click deployment settings > allow deployments of components when corresponding apex jobs are pending or in progress , and then click save .
as part of this change , the deployment connections page has been renamed to deployment settings .
this option applies to change sets and deployments started through the metadata api .
note : • enabling this option might cause apex jobs to fail due to unsupported changes . •
this option does n’t affect editing and saving apex code in the salesforce user interface ( in setup or the developer console ) , which will fail if there are active jobs associated with the apex class .
updating apex code by using the force.com ide can succeed if this option is enabled because metadata api is used for the code update .
deploy your components in less time ( pilot ) you can now deploy components to production by skipping the execution of all apex tests for components that have been validated within the last four days .

246 force.com development deploy your components in less time ( pilot ) as part of a deployment to production , all apex tests are run in the production organization .
if the organization contains a large number of apex tests , the execution of all tests can be time - consuming and can delay your deployment .
to reduce deployment time to production , you can perform a quick deployment by skipping the execution of all tests .
quick deployments are available only for validations with test runs that have passed in the last four days ( 96 hours ) and that meet the code coverage requirements : the overall code coverage in the organization must be at least 75% , and apex triggers must have some coverage .
to perform a quick deployment , first run a validation - only deployment with apex test execution on the set of components that you need to deploy to production .
if your validation succeeds and qualifies for a quick deployment , you can start a quick deployment by clicking quick deploy next to your validation in the deployment status page or in the validation ’s detail page .
this button appears only for qualifying validations .
you can start a quick deployment only through the salesforce user interface .
quick deploy is available for change sets and metadata api - based deployments that appear in the user interface .
note :  quick deploy is enabled for recent validations in which all apex tests have executed successfully and code coverage requirements have been met .
note the following : • because apex tests are required to run in production , quick deployments are supported for validations that meet the criteria .
this applies to change sets and metadata api - based deployments ( including the force.com migration tool ) . •
when deploying to non - production environments ( sandbox ) , apex tests are n’t required and are n’t run automatically .
when using metadata api ( including the force.com migration tool ) , quick deploy is supported in sandbox only for validations that explicitly enable the execution of tests ( for example , via the runalltests  parameter for the migration tool ) .
for change sets , quick deploy is not supported in sandbox because there is no option to enable test runs for change sets . •
if you perform a deployment after a validation , whether through quick deploy or a regular deployment , all validations no longer qualify for quick deployment .
you must revalidate the set of components that you need to quick - deploy .

provide canvas personal apps directly
to end users canvas personal apps let you create connected apps designed specifically for end users across organizations , without relying on organization administrators for app distribution .
with canvas personal apps , end users can discover , install , and seamlessly interact with the apps that you create .
as an administrator , you can still install canvas apps in an organization .
canvas personal apps give developers new freedom to create apps and allow users to install and use the apps immediately .
canvas personal apps also offer a lightweight way to integrate outside functionality with salesforce for any number of users .
end users install and use a canvas personal app right from the chatter tab , which allows the app to connect to their salesforce data . because only the app ’s metadata is installed , installation is quick and easy , and end users get only the functionality that they need .

use salesforce1 methods to integrate navigation with canvas apps leverage new methods in the force.com canvas framework to smoothly integrate navigation or record actions between a canvas app and salesforce1 , without needing to use visualforce .
now your development tools are within a single framework .
previously , the only way to circumvent the navigational limitations of the iframe that contains a canvas app was to use visualforce pages .
these force.com
canvas methods offer a simpler alternative for controlling navigation to or from canvas apps in salesforce1 .
for example , your canvas app code can call salesforce1 " create record " logic to navigate to the page where the create account button resides . clicking the button
triggers a salesforce1 navigation method to go to the record creation page , which is outside of the canvas app .
reference the navigation method as an event variable , with name and payload .
for example : var event = { name:"s1.createrecord " , payload : { entityname : " account " , recordtypeid : " 00h300000001234 " } } ; for more information , see “ salesforce1 navigation methods for use with canvas apps ” in the force.com canvas developer ’s guide .
sdk object and field changes the following changes have been made to the objects and fields in the force.com canvas sdk . •

combining style sheets reduces the number of network connections that are required to load a page and its resources .
reducing the number of connections improves performance modestly and should particularly affect higher - latency connections , such as those on some mobile networks .
preserve sobject field encryption in visualforce expressions for visualforce pages set to api version 32.0 or later , expressions that reference encrypted sobject fields return the encrypted values instead of the decrypted ( plain ) values .
this behavior more closely matches your expectations and reduces the risk of inadvertent exposure of sensitive data due to programmer error .

standard style sheets combined by visualforce visualforce now combines various style sheets into a single file before referencing or serving them in page requests .
combining style sheets reduces the number of network connections that are required to load a page and its resources .
reducing the number of connections improves performance modestly and should particularly affect higher - latency connections , such as those on some mobile networks .
previously visualforce referenced and served these style sheets separately .
the style sheet content is unchanged .
you do n’t need to do anything to take advantage of this improvement .
preserve sobject field encryption in visualforce expressions for visualforce pages set to api version 32.0 or later , expressions that reference encrypted sobject fields return the encrypted values instead of the decrypted ( plain ) values .
this behavior more closely matches your expectations and reduces the risk of inadvertent exposure of sensitive data due to programmer error .
an expression might be used with a visualforce component that displays it , such as < apex : outputtext >  or < apex : column > , or as a “
raw ”
expression on the page , for example , { ! myobject__c.encryptedfield__c } .
in these scenarios , the encrypted value , rather than the decrypted value , of the field is displayed .
this behavior parallels the documented behavior of < apex : inputfield > and < apex : outputfield > , which display encrypted values for encrypted fields .
pages set to api version 31.0 or earlier continue to display decrypted values for encrypted sobject fields , except when displayed by using < apex : inputfield > and < apex : outputfield>. this change is versioned , and you must update your pages to api version 32.0 or later to see the changed functionality .
252 force.com development apex code note :  because apex does n’t have an encrypted data type , expressions that reference controller properties or methods that return apex variables — that is , apex values rather than sobject values — always display plain ( decrypted ) values .
serve static resources from the visualforce domain when activated , this update changes the way that your static resources , such as images , javascript , and css files , are served from salesforce .
to avoid broken references to static resources , make sure that you review our recommended best practices .
prior to the winter ’15 release , some static resources , such as images and css files , were loaded from the salesforce domain .
this update changes that behavior so that all static resources are loaded from the visualforce domain .
this change to the origin domain can cause absolute references to static resources to break .
it ’s a best practice to reference static resources by using the $ resource  global variable and the urlfor ( )  function instead of static strings .
for example : • < apex : includescript value="{!$resource .
myjavascriptfile}"/ > •
< apex : image url="{!urlfor($resource
. testzip , ' images / bluehills.jpg ' ) } " width="50 " height="50"/ > these references are safe to use regardless of your organization ’s settings for this critical update .
we recommend that you test this update in a sandbox or developer edition organization to verify correct behavior of your pages before enabling it in your production organization .
to activate this critical update : 1 .
from setup , click critical updates .
2 . click activate for “ serve static resources from visualforce domain . ”
apex code using syntax that looks like java and acts like database stored procedures , apex enables developers to add business logic to most system events , including button clicks , related record updates , and visualforce pages .
apex code execution can be initiated by web service requests and from triggers on objects .

this section : submit and monitor jobs for asynchronous execution with the queueable interface take control of your asynchronous apex processes by using the queueable  interface .
this interface enables you to add jobs to the queue and monitor them , which is an enhanced way of running your asynchronous apex code compared to using future methods .
run more future methods and callouts
the execution limits of future methods and callouts in an apex transaction have increased to 50 methods and 100 callouts respectively .
these limit increases enable you to do more with apex without having to be restricted by the previous limits .
run more tests in sandbox and developer organizations the test execution limit for asynchronous tests has increased and you can now run twice as many tests in large sandbox or developer edition organizations . 253 force.com development submit and monitor jobs for asynchronous execution with the queueable interface apex triggers supported for the territory2 object use triggers on the territory2 object to automate actions or processes related to customizations or record updates .

apex supported for the searchpromotionrule sobject promoted search terms are useful for promoting a salesforce knowledge article that you know is commonly used to resolve a support issue when an end user ’s search contains certain keywords .
users can promote an article in search results by associating keywords with the article in apex ( by using the searchpromotionrule sobject ) in addition to the salesforce user interface .
new and changed apex classes these classes , methods , and interfaces are new or have changed in this release .
submit and monitor jobs for asynchronous execution with the queueable interface take control of your asynchronous apex processes by using the queueable  interface .
this interface enables you to add jobs to the queue and monitor them , which is an enhanced way of running your asynchronous apex code compared to using future methods .
for apex processes that run for a long time , such as extensive database operations or external web service callouts , you can run them asynchronously by implementing the queueable interface and adding a job to the apex job queue .
in this way , your asynchronous apex job runs in the background in its own thread and does n’t delay the execution of your main apex logic .
each queued job runs when system resources become available .
a benefit of using the queueable  interface methods is that some governor limits are higher than for synchronous apex , such as heap size limits .
queueable jobs are similar to future methods in that they ’re both queued for execution , but they provide you with these additional benefits . •
getting an id for your job : when you submit your job by invoking the system.enqueuejob  method , the method returns the id of the new job .
this id corresponds to the id of the asyncapexjob record .
you can use this id to identify your job and monitor its progress , either through the salesforce user interface in the apex jobs page , or programmatically by querying your record from asyncapexjob . • chaining jobs : you can chain one job to another by starting a second job from a running job . chaining jobs is useful if you need to do some processing that depends on another process to have run first .
example this example is an implementation of the queueable  interface .
the execute  method in this example inserts a new account .
public class asyncexecutionexample implements queueable { public void execute(queueablecontext context ) { account a = new account(name='acme',phone='(415 ) 555 - 1212 ' ) ; insert a ; } } to add this class as a job on the queue , call this method : id jobid = system.enqueuejob(new asyncexecutionexample ( ) ) ; after you submit your queueable class for execution , the job is added to the queue and will be processed when system resources become available . you can monitor the status of your job programmatically by querying asyncapexjob or through the user interface in setup by clicking jobs > apex jobs .
254 force.com development submit and monitor jobs for asynchronous execution with the queueable interface to query information about your submitted job , perform a soql query on asyncapexjob by filtering on the job id that the system.enqueuejob  method returns .
this example uses the jobid variable that was obtained in the previous example .
asyncapexjob jobinfo = [ select status , numberoferrors from asyncapexjob where id=:jobid ] ; similar to future jobs , queueable jobs do n’t process batches , and so the number of processed batches and the number of total batches are always zero . testing queueable jobs this example shows how to test the execution of a queueable job in a test method .
a queueable job is an asynchronous process .
to ensure that this process runs within the test method , the job is submitted to the queue between the test.starttest  and test.stoptest  block .
the system executes all asynchronous processes started in a test method synchronously after the test.stoptest  statement .
next , the test method verifies the results of the queueable job by querying the account that the job created .
@istest public class asyncexecutionexampletest { static testmethod void test1 ( ) { to run in the test . //
starttest / stoptest block to force async processes //
test.starttest ( ) ; system.enqueuejob(new asyncexecutionexample ( ) ) ; test.stoptest ( ) ; //
validate that the job has run // by verifying that the record was created . //
this query returns only the account created in test context by the //
queueable class method .
account acct = [ select name , phone from account where name='acme ' limit 1 ] ; system.assertnotequals(null , acct ) ; system.assertequals('(415 ) 555 - 1212 ' , acct .
phone ) ; } } note :  the id of a queueable apex job is n’t returned in test context —
system.enqueuejob  returns null in a running test . chaining jobs
if you need to run a job after some other processing is done first by another job , you can chain queueable jobs .
the maximum number of jobs in the chain ( maximum stack depth ) is two , which means that you can link a job only once .
to chain a job to another , submit the second job from the execute ( )  method of your queueable class .
you can add only one job from an executing job .
for example , if you have a second class called secondjob  that implements the queueable  interface , you can add this class to the queue in the execute ( )  method as follows : public class asyncexecutionexample implements queueable { public void execute(queueablecontext context ) { //
your processing logic here //
chain this job to next job by submitting the next job system.enqueuejob(new secondjob ( ) ) ; } } 255 force.com development run more future methods and callouts you ca n’t chain queueable jobs in an apex test .
doing so results in an error .
to avoid getting an error , you can check if apex is running in test context by calling test.isrunningtest ( ) before chaining jobs .
queueable apex limits • the execution of a queued job counts once against the shared limit for asynchronous apex method executions . •
you can add up to 50 jobs to the queue with system.enqueuejob  in a single transaction . •
the maximum stack depth for chained jobs is two , which means that you can link a job only once and have a maximum of two jobs in the chain . •
when chaining jobs , you can add only one job from an executing job with system.enqueuejob .
run more future methods and callouts
the execution limits of future methods and callouts in an apex transaction have increased to 50 methods and 100 callouts respectively .
these limit increases enable you to do more with apex without having to be restricted by the previous limits .
for example , you might have transferred much of your long - running code to future methods that you call and run asynchronously from your main class .
if you did many of these future calls in your class , you might have hit the limit of 10 future calls in one transaction .
with the increased limit of 50 calls , you can make many more future calls without likely hitting this limit .
the following limits have increased .
limit description maximum number of methods with the future  annotation allowed per apex invocation 10 maximum number of callouts ( http requests or web services calls ) in a transaction 10 old value new value 50 100 run more tests in sandbox and developer organizations the test execution limit for asynchronous tests has increased and you can now run twice as many tests in large sandbox or developer edition organizations .
for sandbox and developer edition organizations , the following test execution limit for asynchronous tests has increased .
limit value maximum number of test classes that can be queued per 24-hour period
the greater of 500 or 20 multiplied by the number of test classes in the organization the increase is in the portion of the limit that varies with the number of test classes in your organization—20 ( instead of 10 ) multiplied by the number of test classes in the organization .
if your organization has a large number of test classes ( 26 or more test classes ) , you will benefit from this increase and you can run twice the number of tests than what was previously possible .
the increase in the test execution limit increase applies to sandbox organizations in all supported editions and developer edition organizations .
this limit is unchanged for production organizations in all other editions . 256 force.com development apex triggers supported for the territory2 object apex triggers supported for the territory2 object use triggers on the territory2 object to automate actions or processes related to customizations or record updates .
example :  for example , you might create a trigger that reads a custom field and tracks the number of territories in each territory model , incrementing or decrementing the count each time a territory is created or deleted .
apex triggers supported for the userterritory2association object use triggers on the userterritory2association object to automate actions or processes related to customizations or record updates .
example :  for example , you might create a trigger that sends an email notification to your company ’s sales operations group to let them know when users are added to territories .
apex supported for the searchpromotionrule sobject promoted search terms are useful for promoting a salesforce knowledge article that you know is commonly used to resolve a support issue when an end user ’s search contains certain keywords .
users can promote an article in search results by associating keywords with the article in apex ( by using the searchpromotionrule sobject ) in addition to the salesforce user interface .
example :  this code sample shows how to add a search promotion rule .
this sample performs a query to get published articles of type myarticle__kav .
next , the sample creates a searchpromotionrule sobject to promote articles that contain the word “ salesforce ” and assigns the first returned article to it .
finally , the sample inserts this new sobject . //
identify the article to promote in search results list < myarticle__kav > articles = [ select i d from myarticle__kav where publishstatus='online ' and language='en_us ' and id='article i d ' ] ; // define the promotion rule searchpromotionrule s = new searchpromotionrule ( query='salesforce ' , promotedentity = articles[0 ] ) ; //
save the new rule insert s ; to perform dml operations on the searchpromotionrule sobject , you must enable salesforce knowledge .

connectapi ( chatter in apex ) to create custom chatter experiences in salesforce , use chatter in apex .
many chatter rest api resource actions are exposed as static methods on apex classes in the connectapi  namespace .
these methods use other connectapi  classes to input and return information .
the connectapi  namespace is referred to as chatter in apex .
in apex , it ’s possible to access some chatter data using soql queries and objects .
however , connectapi  classes expose chatter data in a much simpler way .
data is localized and structured for display .
for example , instead of making many calls to access and assemble a feed , you can do it with a single call .
note :  to integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third - party web applications with chatter , use chatter rest api .

this section : general updates to chatter in apex new and changed chatter in apex classes new and changed chatter in apex input classes new and changed chatter in apex output classes new and changed chatter in apex enums 261 force.com development new and changed apex classes general updates to chatter in apex feed elements important :  api version 32.0 introduces new methods that get , search , update , and post feed elements .
these methods operate on and return new input and output classes that represent feed elements .
older methods and classes that operate on and represent feed items are n’t supported in api version 32.0 .
the documentation for older methods and classes contains links to the documentation for the newer methods and classes .
in api versions 30.0 and earlier , a chatter feed was a container of feed items .
in api version 31.0 , the definition of a feed expanded to include new objects that did n’t entirely fit the feed item model .
the chatter feed became a container of “ feed elements .
”
the abstract class connectapi .
feedelement  was introduced as a parent class to the existing connectapi .
feeditem  class and the subset of properties that feed elements share was moved into the connectapi .
feedelement  class .
this change allows the chatter feed to contain both feed items and other objects that inherit from the connectapi .
feedelement class , such as recommendations ( which are connectapi .
genericfeedelement  objects with a recommendations capability ) .
feed elements inheritance diagram api version 31.0 introduced methods that operate on feed elements instead of on feed items .
detailed information about these changes are in the feed elements section of new and changed chatter in apex classes .
detailed information about the new feed element input and output classes are in those sections of the release notes .
capabilities important :  attachments are not supported in api version 32.0 .
all attachment functionality has been moved into capabilities .
whereas a feed item could have only one attachment , feed items can now have multiple capabilities .
the documentation for attachments contains links to the new capabilities .
as part of the effort to diversify the feed , pieces of functionality found in feed elements have been broken out into capabilities .
capabilities provide a consistent way to interact with objects in the feed .
instead of inspecting feed item type and using other indirect means to 262 force.com development new and changed apex classes determine which functionality is available for a specific feed element , the capabilities object tells you explicitly what is available .
a client should check for the presence of a capability to determine what it can do to a feed element .
in version 32.0 and later , every feed element can have a unique set of capabilities .
a capability object includes both an indication that a feature is possible and data associated with that feature .
if a capability property exists on a feed element , that capability is available , even if there is n’t any data associated with the capability yet .
for example , if the chatterlikes  capability property exists on a feed element ( with or without any likes included in the list of likes found in the chatterlikes.page.items  property ) , the context user can like that feed element .
if the capability property does n’t exist on a feed element , it is n’t possible to like that feed element .
capabilities inheritance diagram detailed information about these changes are in the “ capabilities ” sections of the release notes .
recommendations recommendations are new to the chatter feed in api version 32.0 .
recommendations are connectapi .
genericfeedelement objects with a connectapi .
recommentationscapability .
they ’re an example of what ’s possible with the new feed element and capabilities architecture .
the news feed in salesforce1 mobile browser app can include recommendations about useful groups to join .

new and changed chatter in apex classes batch posting feed elements post a batch of up to 500 feed elements for the cost of one dml statement .
for example , you could create a trigger that bulk posts to the feeds of newly inserted accounts .
post a batch of feed elements use the chatterfeeds.postfeedelementbatch(string , list < connectapi .
batchinput > )  method .
in the connectapi .
batchinput  constructor , the input object must be a concrete instance of the abstract connectapi .
feedelementinput  class .
capabilities see capabilities on page 262 for general information about capabilities and how they have changed in api version 32.0 .

287 force.com development lightning components ( beta ) lightning components ( beta ) the lightning component framework powers salesforce1 .
you can use it to create your own lightning components and make them available to salesforce1 users .
editions note :  this release contains a beta version of lightning components that is production quality but has known limitations .
components are reusable sections of the ui and can range in granularity from a single line of text to an entire app .
components interact with each other by listening to or firing events .
available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions use the lightning component framework to develop dynamic web apps for mobile and desktop devices .
it ’s a modern framework for building single - page applications engineered for growth .
the client - server ui architecture enables you to use javascript on the client side and apex on the server side .
for more information , see the lightning components developer ’s guide .
benefits there are many benefits of using the framework .
out - of - the - box component set comes with an out - of - the - box set of components to kick start building apps .
you do n't have to spend your time optimizing your apps for different devices as the components take care of that for you .
performance uses a stateful client and stateless server architecture that relies on javascript on the client side to manage ui component metadata and application data .
the framework uses json to exchange data between the server and the client .
to maximize efficiency , the server only sends data that is needed by the user .
intelligently utilizes your server , browser , devices , and network so you can focus on the logic and interactions of your apps .
event - driven architecture uses an event - driven architecture for better decoupling between components .
any component can subscribe to an application event , or to a component event they can see .
faster development empowers teams to work faster with out - of - the - box components that function seamlessly with desktop and mobile devices .
building an app with components facilitates parallel design , improving overall development efficiency .
components are encapsulated and their internals stay private , while their public shape is visible to consumers of the component .
this strong separation gives component authors freedom to change the internal implementation details and insulates component consumers from those changes .
device - aware and cross browser compatibility apps are responsive and provide an enjoyable user experience .
the lightning component framework supports the latest in browser technology such as html5 , css3 , and touch events .
known limitations the beta version of lightning components has some known limitations .

288 force.com development ui changes limited set of out - of - the - box components the beta includes a very limited set of components .
namespace prefix required your organization must have a namespace prefix required to develop lightning components .
open source aura framework the lightning component framework is built on the open source aura framework .
aura is open sourced at https://github.com/forcedotcom/aura .
you can build general - purpose web apps hosted on your own server .
your apps can be completely independent of salesforce and your data in salesforce .
note that the open source aura framework has features and components that are not currently available in the lightning component framework .
we are working to surface more of these features and components for salesforce developers .

use this header to specify a default namespace , enabling you to resolve field names in managed packages without having to specify the namespace everywhere .
the following example sets the default namespace to battle : sforce - call - options : client = samplecasesensitivetoken/100 , defaultnamespace = battle then queries such as the following will succeed : /vxx.x / query/?q = select+id+botid__c+from+account in this case the actual field queried is the battle__botid__c  field .
package version header the package version header is a request header applied when working with managed packages .
use this header to specify the version of each package referenced by your api client .

this section : general updates new and changed resources new and changed request bodies new and changed response bodies general updates feed elements in api versions 30.0 and earlier , a chatter feed was a container of feed items .
in api version 31.0 , the definition of a feed expanded to include new objects that did n’t entirely fit the feed item model .
the chatter feed became a container of feed elements .
in api version 32.0 , feed elements can be either feed items or generic feed elements .
generic feed elements do n’t have an actor  property , which means they can be used for system - generated content like the new recommendations in the feed .
300 force.com development chatter rest api this table shows the properties that are shared by generic feed element and feed item , and the properties that are unique to feed item .

these resources operate on and return new request and response bodies that represent feed elements .
older resources , request bodies , and response bodies that operate on and represent only feed items are n’t supported in api version 32.0 .
the documentation for older resources , request bodies , and response bodies contains links to the documentation for the newer resources , request bodies , and response bodies . detailed information about these changes are in the following “ feed elements ” sections .
capabilities as part of the effort to diversify the feed , pieces of functionality found in feed elements have been broken out into capabilities .
capabilities provide a consistent way to interact with objects in the feed .
instead of inspecting feed item type and using other indirect means to determine which functionality is available for a specific feed element , the capabilities object tells you explicitly what is available .
a client should check for the presence of a capability to determine what it can do to a feed element .
all feed elements have a capabilities  property , which holds a feed element capabilities response body .
the feed element capabilities response body can have one or more properties , each holding a capability of the feed element .

capability topics capability tracked changes capability
in version 32.0 and later , every feed element can have a unique set of capabilities .
a capability includes both an indication that a feature is possible and data associated with that feature .
if a capability exists on a feed element , that capability is available , even if there is n’t any data associated with the capability yet .
for example , if the chatterlikes  capability property exists on a feed element ( with or without any likes included in the list of likes found in the chatterlikes.page.items  property ) , the context user can like that feed element .
if the capability property does n’t exist on a feed element , it is n’t possible to like that feed element .
important :  in api version 32.0 , new resources have been introduced that operate on the capabilities of feed elements .
these resources operate on and return new request and response bodies that represent capabilities .
older resources , request bodies , and response bodies are not supported in api version 32.0 .
in addition , all attachment functionality has been moved into capabilities and attachments are not supported in api version 32.0 .
whereas a feed item could have only one attachment , feed items can now have multiple capabilities .
the documentation for attachments contains links to the new capabilities . detailed information about these changes are in the following “ capabilities ” sections .
302 force.com development chatter rest api recommendations recommendations are new to the chatter feed in api version 32.0 .
the news feed in salesforce1 mobile browser app can include recommendations about useful groups to join .
the feed can also recommend the today app but this option can be turned off from setup > customize > chatter > settings .
recommendations are generic feed elements with a recommendations capability .
they ’re an example of what ’s possible with the new feed element and capabilities architecture .
recommendations detailed information about these changes are in the following “ recommendations ” sections .
use cors ( cross - origin resource sharing ) to access chatter rest api note :  to enable this feature , contact your salesforce representative .
in api version 32.0 , only chatter rest api supports cors .
rest api does not support cors .
cors is a w3c recommendation that enables web browsers to request resources from origins other than their own ( cross - origin requests ) .
for example , using cors , a javascript script at https://www.example.com  could request a resource from https://www.salesforce.com . chatter rest api supports cors ( cross - origin resource sharing ) .
to access this api from javascript in a web browser , add the origin serving the script to the cors whitelist .
to add an origin to the cors whitelist , from setup , choose security controls > cors .
click new and enter an origin url pattern .
the origin url pattern must include https and a domain name , and may include a port .
the wildcard character ( * ) is supported and must be in front of a second - level domain name .
for example , https://*.example.com  adds all the subdomains of example.com  to the whitelist .
if a browser that supports cors makes a request to an origin in the salesforce cors whitelist , salesforce returns the origin in the access - control - allow - origin  http header , along with any additional cors http headers .
if the origin is not in the whitelist , salesforce returns http status code 404 .
you must still pass an oauth token with requests that require it .

an action link is an indicator on a feed element that targets an api , a web page , or a file and is represented by a button in the salesforce chatter feed ui .
an action link includes an http method and can include header information , such as a bearer token for authentication .
use action links to integrate salesforce and third - party systems into the feed .
the highlighted buttons are action links : 304 force.com development chatter rest api
in version 32.0 of the pilot , action links are no longer restricted to the salesforce1 mobile browser app .
