example :  your professional edition organization uses sales cloud , chatter , and analytics cloud .
first you want to see all relevant release notes that your users will have immediate access to when spring ’15 is released .
do just that with these filters .

updated skin we updated the html release notes to reflect our updated look .
relocated and contextualized the list of release notes we moved the list of release notes from the left side of the screen to the right , so you can focus on the content of the release notes .
because the list of release notes is contained in a smaller box , you always know where in the list you are .
the release note that you ’re currently viewing is always visible ; more often than not , it ’s at the top of the list . 40 salesforce spring ’15 release notes supported browsers select the language you want to read by default , your browser ’s language settings determine the language we show you in the html release notes .
now you can easily change the language that you ’re viewing the release notes in .
scroll to the footer at the bottom of the page , click change language , and select a language .
before spring ’15 , the only way to view the release notes in a different language was to manually change the language key in the url .
for example , if you were viewing the release notes in german and wanted to view them in english , you ’d change de - de  in the url to en - us .

get faster and more relevant search results ( generally available ) we ’ve updated the search engine , bringing you faster , smarter search and more relevant results throughout salesforce , including global search , sidebar search , and advanced search in the full salesforce site , salesforce1 , and your custom search implementations that use the sosl search api .
editions available in all editions in the winter ’15 release , salesforce knowledge article search was updated with the new search infrastructure .
in spring ’15 , we ’re expanding this search infrastructure to all salesforce search utilities .
this expanded enhancement was previously available only through a pilot program .
these improvements and new search capabilities are available on a rolling basis after spring ’15 is released , and before the summer ’15 release is rolled out .
faster indexing it now takes less time for records to be searchable after they ’re created or updated .
improved tokenization a key enhancement of the new search infrastructure is the change from bigram tokenization to morphological tokenization .
when users search , the search engine returns results based on tokens in the search string that match tokens in the index .
with improved tokenization , content is indexed more appropriately , resulting in fewer irrelevant matches in search results .
morphological tokenization ensures that searches in east asian languages such as chinese , japanese , korean , and thai ( cjkt ) , which do n’t include spaces between words , return accurate search results .
previously , when indexing a string of characters , the search engine applied bigram tokenization to segment the string into pairs of characters , known as bigrams .
for example , before spring ’15 , a search for 京都 ( kyoto ) in japanese incorrectly included 東京都 ( tokyo prefecture ) in the search results .
using bigramming , 東京都 ( tokyo prefecture ) was tokenized as these bigrams .
東京 tokyo 京都 kyoto with morphological tokenization , the same phrase is properly segmented into these tokens . 東京 tokyo 都 prefecture in this context , both tokens are meaningful and correct , and 京都 ( kyoto ) is n’t tokenized . 44 salesforce spring ’15 release notes get faster and more relevant search results ( generally available )
now , a search for 京都 ( kyoto ) returns only results that include 京都 ( kyoto ) and not 東京都 ( tokyo prefecture ) .
important :  if you use cjkt languages , we recommend running business scenarios in your sandbox environment to ensure that your integrations that rely on sosl continue to work as expected after the upgrade .
limitation with japanese language users querying records that are tokenized as chinese if a record contains at least 300 characters and contains kanji only ( no katakana or hiragana ) , the content is tokenized as chinese .
therefore , a japanese language user searching for this record does n’t find it in search results .
kanji - only records with fewer than 300 characters are tokenized in chinese and japanese .
improved alphanumeric search thanks to more efficient handling of punctuation , we ’ve improved search results when you search for specialized strings such as urls , email addresses , and phone numbers .
punctuation symbols—<>[]{}()!,.;:"'— at the beginning or end of a tokenized string are removed from indexed content and from users’ searches .
removing these characters makes it easier for the search engine to recognize when a user is searching for a phone number , as in this example : ( 415 )  is tokenized as 415 .
previously , if a user searched for きっと、来る in japanese , the punctuation caused this matching string to be excluded from search results : きっと来る.
now , the same string results in a match .
words that contain both letters and numbers are split into separate tokens .
for example , web2lead is broken up into these tokens : web2lead , web2 , web , 2 , and lead .
a search for web  matches items that contain web2lead ; however , a search for web2lead  only returns results that include the full term , web2lead .
previously , a search for web2lead  returned matches with web , 2 , and lead , even if those terms were in separate places within the item .
as another example , a record name that includes letters , numbers , and punctuation is broken up into several tokens .
record name abc - record - xyz1234 indexed tokens abc - record - xyz1234 abcrecordxyz1234 abc record 1234 xyz1234 xyz a search for any of these indexed tokens returns the record abc - record - xyz1234 .
further , when you search for an exact match , using either quotation marks ( “ ” ) or sidebar search , special characters are treated as part of the search term to help you find the record that you ’re looking for .
for example , if you search for 100!% , we match only 100!% .
we do n’t match items with 100% .
before spring ’15 , if you searched for an exact match for 100!% , we matched items with 100 or 100% .
improved validation of the and not operator in searches that do n’t include a word before and after the and not operator , “ and ” and “ not ” are included in the search term .
for example , a search for and not apples  returns items with the word apples , while a search for oranges and not apples does n’t return items with the word apples .
for more information about searching on the new search infrastructure , see “ how search works ” in the salesforce help .

email dkim signing outbound email use the domainkeys identified mail ( dkim ) key feature to enable salesforce to sign outbound emails sent on your organization ’s behalf .
a valid signature provides recipients confidence that the email was handled by a third party such as salesforce in a way authorized by your organization .
when you create a dkim key , salesforce generates a public and private key pair .
you must publish the public key in the dns , which tells recipients that you , as the owner of the domain , have authorized the use of this key to sign your mail .
salesforce uses the private key to create dkim signature headers on your outgoing email .
then , recipients of the mail , can compare the signature header with the public key in the dns to determine that the mail was signed with an authorized key .
if your domain also publishes a domain - based message authentication , reporting and conformance ( dmarc ) policy , recipients can use the dkim signature to verify that the mail conforms to dmarc .
editions available in : • enterprise • unlimited • developer user permissions
to manage dkim key • customize application the emaildomainkey object consists of these fields .
• domain — the organization ’s domain name that the dkim key is generated for . •
domainmatch —
the specificity of match required on the sending domain name before signing with this dkim key .
valid values are : – domainonly – subdomainsonly
– domainandsubdomains • isactive — indicates whether this dkim key is active ( true ) or not ( false ) .
• privatekey —
the private portion of the dkim key pair used to encrypt mail headers from your domain .
salesforce generates an encrypted privatekey  if you do n’t specify a value when creating the dkim key .
if you do specify a value , it must be an existing valid privatekey  from another emaildomainkey object .
this field does n’t contain the actual private key , but a value that represents the key in our system .
therefore : – the actual private key ca n’t be leaked . –
you ca n’t use the value to do your own email signing . •
publickey —
part of the domain key pair that mail recipients retrieve to decrypt the dkim header and verify your domain .
add the publickey  value to your domain ’s dns records before you start signing with this domain key .
otherwise , mail recipients may reject your email .
• selector —
text used to distinguish the dkim key from any other dkim keys your organization uses for the specified domain .
for each domain key you create , we recommend this sequence : insert the domain , domainmatch , and selector . 1 . 2 .
update your domain ’s dns records .
a. locate the dns record at selector._domainkey.domain .
for example , mail._domainkey.mail.example.com .
b. add the publickey value , like this : v = dkim1 ; p = public_key .
dkim signing outbound email a.
in addition , you can optionally put the record in testing mode , which instructs recipients to not make decisions based on the email signature .
add parameter t = y  to the dns entry , like this : v = dkim1 ; t = y ; p = public_key . 3 .
update the key via the api or ui to be active .
consider the following when using domain keys .
49 salesforce spring ’15 release notes email ip ranges updated • make sure you add the public key to your dns record before you make your key active in salesforce and start dkim signing .
dkim signing is active whenever your dkim key is in the active state . •
you ca n’t have more than one active dkim key per domain name .
you might have multiple active dkim keys if your organization mails from more than a single domain or if you use subdomains under your organizational domain and have specified domain matching at the subdomain level . •
if you want to use the same dkim key for multiple organizations , you can .
create the key and ensure it ’s working for one organization first .
then using the api or ui create the key in your other organizations by setting the corresponding fields in the new key to the same values as the original . •
when you insert or update a dkim key , it ’s possible that the change affects existing domain keys .
for example , if you ’ve set domainmatch  to domainandsubdomains  for the example.com domain , and you then set domainmatch  to subdomainsonly  for the mail.example.com domain , either key could be used .
here ’s how we resolve conflicts in the case when dkim keys overlap .
–
if two keys are equally specific about matching for the same domain , the new key replaces and deactivates the existing key . –
if a new key is more specific about matching than an existing key , the new key is used and the existing key is modified to inactive . –
if multiple keys have different domains that match the sending domain , the key with the longest domain name is used .
in case of a tie , the most specific key is used .
for example , because domainonly  and subdomainsonly  are more specific than domainandsubdomains , a new domainonly  key would change the domainmatch  for an existing domainandsubdomains  key to become subdomainsonly .
in case of a tie , the most specific key is used .
email ip ranges updated the ip ranges that salesforce uses to send email have changed .
if your organization blocks any of the ip addresses , users may not receive all email sent from salesforce .
update your whitelisted ip addresses .
the new ip ranges are : • 96.43.144.64 to 96.43.144.65 • 96.43.147.64 to 96.43.147.79 • 96.43.148.64 to 96.43.148.65 • 96.43.151.64 to 96.43.151.79 • 136.146.128.64 to 136.146.128.79 • 182.50.78.64 to 182.50.78.79 • 204.14.232.64 to 204.14.232.79 • 204.14.234.64 to 204.14.234.79

partial internationalization support available international date , time , and number formats are supported in the wave interface .
the following limitations apply : • you must set both locale and language to see translated labels . •
data within datasets is not localized .
• sorting data within datasets may not work as expected . •
each dataset may have a single locale specified in the metadata .
everyone viewing that dataset will see the the same date , time , and number formats , as well as dimension names , regardless of their own locale and language settings .
• search in filters is both case - sensitive and accent - sensitive .
for example , using the filter “
andre ” does not return “ andré ” in the results . • multicurrency is not supported .
when the analytics cloud extracts your organization ’s default currency , it uses the currency for monetary values and does n’t convert to another currency .

with incremental extraction , sfdcdigest inserts , updates , and deletes records in the dataset to match the record changes in the salesforce object since the last dataflow run .
if the data in the dataset and salesforce object become out of sync while using incremental extractions , you can perform a one - time full extraction to synchronize the data .
filter extracted salesforce records to decrease extraction time add a filter to the sfdcdigest transformation to extract a subset of all records from a salesforce object .
you can filter records to reduce the number of extracted and processed records , exclude records that contain irrelevant or sensitive data , and decrease extraction time .
a filter consists of one or more filter conditions , where each filter condition compares a field value to a value .
for example , amount > = 1000000 .
you can also apply soql functions on the field value in a filter condition , like calendar_year(createddate ) = 2011 .
you can add multiple filter conditions using logical operators and , or , and not .
the sfdcdigest transformation extracts all records for which the filter is true .
if you add an invalid filter , the dataflow fails at run time . 59 salesforce spring ’15 release notes new in spring ` 15 plus append records from multiple datasets into a single dataset add the append transformation to the dataflow to append records from multiple datasets into a single dataset .
combine the records to enable queries across the datasets .
for example , you can create a single dataset from monthly sales target datasets that you ’ve been creating each month .
after you combine the data into a single dataset , you can use filters to analyze the sales targets by different time periods , like months , quarters , and years .
note :  to use the append transformation , the columns in the input datasets must match .
they must have the same names , field types , and order .
update a dataset
based on another dataset add the update transformation to the dataflow to update field values in dataset records based on data from another dataset .
for each record , the transformation looks up the new values from fields in the matched record of the other dataset .
for example , you have an accounts dataset that contains account id , name , and annual revenue .
unfortunately , some of the account names in the dataset are incorrect because of recent mergers and acquisitions .
you can use this transformation to quickly update the account names using another dataset that has the new account names for each account id .
external data enhancements analytics cloud now generates the metadata file for you when you upload a .csv file from the user interface .

before you upload the generated metadata file , download it and verify that it contains the correct metadata settings .
if needed , you can change the settings , and upload the modified version .
if analytics cloud ca n’t generate the metadata file , you can manually create it .
new external data metadata fields new metadata fields have been added to give you greater control when you are uploading external data from a csv file .
the following fields have been added to the fields section of the metadata json file : 60 salesforce spring ’15 release notes new in spring ` 15 plus cantruncatevalue indicates whether to truncate a value when the value exceeds the precision .
isyearendfiscalyear indicates whether the year end is based on the fiscal year . isskipped indicates whether to skip the field when the data is uploaded .
decimalseparator the character that separates digits in a decimal number .
can be used to handle international number formats where the decimal separator is “ , ” .
firstdayofweek the first day of the week .
use 0 to set the first day to be sunday , 1 to set the first day to be monday , and so on .
use -1 for the day on which january 1 falls for the year .
incremental loading with the insightsexternaldata object append , upsert , and delete operations have been added to the insightsexternaldata object to support incremental loading of external data .
the following values are now enabled for the operation field of the insightsexternaldata object .
append append all data to the dataset .

upsert insert or update rows in the dataset .
creates a dataset if it does n’t exist .
the rows to upsert must contain one ( and only one ) field with a unique identifier .
delete delete the rows from the dataset .
the rows to delete must contain one ( and only one ) field with a unique identifier .
user permissions to edit a dataset : • “ edit analytics cloud dataflows ”
changing the security predicate for a dataset in the previous release , you could use the dataflow or edit the dataset to change the security predicate .
in the spring ’15 plus release , edit the dataset to change the predicate .
analytics cloud ignores the security predicate setting in the dataflow after the dataset is created . null handling changes analytics cloud has changed how null values in a dataset are handled .
previously , they were replaced with empty string values .
with spring ' 15 plus , they are no longer treated as empty strings , which prevents the augment transformation from incorrectly matching all empty rows .
attention :  columns with all null values wo n't be created in datasets and ca n't be referenced in dataflows , lenses , or dashboards .
all columns must have at least one value .
consider providing a default value for null values , like " n / a " or " empty . "
refer to known issues for full details .
metadata file validation changes analytics cloud has new metadata .json validation rules for external data uploads .
61 salesforce spring ’15 release notes new in spring ` 15 plus if you try to upload an old metadata file that was previously working , but does not conform to the requirements specified in the documentation , analytics cloud now throws an error .
to fix the error , remove the undocumented attributes from the file .

now everyone can have a conversation with data through interactive visualizations .
salesforce analytics rewards your curiosity with fast , responsive answers . exploring any type and combination of data
is now fun , easy , and powerful .
analytics cloud gives you a fast , fluid way to drill through it , discover compelling insights , and share the right visuals to tell your data story .
datasets , lenses , dashboards , and apps are collections of data that represent different levels of refinement — everything from raw data uploaded from your source systems to highly curated , packaged views of your data . •
a dataset is a set of source data , specially formatted and optimized for interactive exploration .
it can be salesforce data , external data , or a combination , such as a mashup of account data and product usage data . •
a lens is a particular view into a dataset .
it ’s where you explore using interactive visualizations .
a visualization is commonly a chart or graph , such as a bar chart , donut chart , timeline , or heatmap .
it can also be data in tabular form , such as a comparison table or pivot table .
every visualization has an underlying query , which is how analytics cloud retrieves information from the source data . •
a dashboard is a curated set of charts , metrics , and tables based on the data in one or more lenses .
dashboards are interactive .
you can tap on charts , buttons , and other elements to dynamically filter and drill into data . •
an app contains dashboards , lenses , and datasets in any combination that makes sense for sharing your data analyses with colleagues .
analytics cloud apps are like folders , allowing users to organize their own data projects — both private and shared — and control sharing .

72 salesforce spring ’15 release notes explore data with powerful visualization tools you read a salesforce analytics dashboard interactively , by clicking the widgets displayed .
every widget is a live , filtered query . •
a selector is a dropdown list that lets you filter down to a particular value that matters to you .
selectors are often tied to each other in sequence so you can progressively drill deeper . •
a rich variety of charts shows you data from multiple angles .
many parts of a chart are interactive .
for example , click a bar in a bar chart and watch what happens . •
some information is best presented by a single number .
some number widgets can be affected by filtering actions you take on charts or selectors . •
a range widget is a controller for filtering other widgets on the dashboard .
in this example , you can set the maximum and minimum sliders to make the dashboard show you only amounts within a specific range .
explore data with powerful visualization tools get to know the boundaries and shape of your data .
use explorer ’s interactive visualization tools to play with different views , zoom in and zoom out , and see what you get with different charting options .
choose from a selection of rich , colorful visualizations to see which views of your data tell the most compelling story .
every visualization in analytics cloud is based on at least one measure , which is anything that can be represented by a number .
measures are typically aggregated in some way .
for example , you can chart two measures side - by - side , showing both the sum of a revenue amount and the average of expected revenue .
measures define the type and scope of your visualization as you explore a dataset .
73 salesforce spring ’15 release notes build powerful queries using saql ( pilot ) visualizations often involve dimensions in addition to measures .
a dimension is anything qualitative that ’s not represented by a number , such as company name , region , and product .
dimensions are handy for grouping your data into useful categories , such as viewing revenue numbers by stage name .
they ’re also handy for filtering unnecessary data out of a visualization , to unclutter your chart and narrow your focus to what ’s most relevant .
exploring your data can lead you down many paths .
not all of them will be fruitful and that ’s okay .
explorer keeps a full history of your activity in a lens .
if you ’ve changed your lens in undesired ways , use history to quickly backtrack to a previous state in your visualization .
share your visualizations with other analytics cloud users .
• give colleagues access to a specific dashboard , lens , or app via a unique url .
• share the app itself , with users , groups , or roles .
• post to chatter the link to a dashboard , lens , or app . •
save a visualization as an image file .

see more record details on object home pages ( tablets
only )
to take advantage of the larger screen on tablets , salesforce1 uses a different object home page interface than what ’s provided on smartphones .
tablet users can see more details about recently viewed records , directly access standard and custom list views , and search across other objects as well as the current object .
the tablet version of object home pages is currently available in the salesforce1 mobile browser app app only .
selecting an object such as accounts , groups , or dashboards from the salesforce1 navigation menu opens the object home page ( previously called “ record search page ” in the salesforce1 help ) . 87 salesforce spring ’15 release notes salesforce1 enhancements in this release here are some important details about object home pages when viewed on tablets .
• object home displays a list of recently viewed records ( 1 ) , with more details than users see on a phone . •
users can access 200 of their standard and custom list views directly from the list view menu ( 2 ) , without having to first access any list views in the full salesforce site .
list views are full - featured and show the same record details as the full site . •
users can sort the recent records list by field , in ascending or descending order .
for example , a sales rep could sort the list of recent leads by the lead status  field to group all qualified leads together .
the easiest way to sort is to tap a field column header .
or tap phone . in the action bar and a select a field ( 3 ) .
sorting is n’t available for the

and the grouping field labels the chart segments .
note :  it ’s not possible to delete list view charts , including those created by your users and the out - of - the - box charts , in this release .

maybe not as obvious , this feature is also useful for improving general performance of the downloadable apps .
when offline access is enabled , recently viewed data is stored in an encrypted , persistent cache on each user ’s mobile device .
the downloadable apps use this cache even when a device is online , which means salesforce1 does n’t need to retrieve data as frequently from salesforce and can display information more quickly .
access the salesforce1 offline settings page in the full salesforce site , from setup , by clicking salesforce1 setup > offline sync .
informational text on this page has been updated to clarify the role of this setting .
and the checkbox on this page is now called enable caching in salesforce1 .
changes to salesforce1 custom branding if you customize the salesforce1 app to match the look and feel of your company ’s branding , there are some changes related to where your custom brand color displays .
custom branding is supported in all versions of salesforce1 . •
the header of all popup , overlay , and dialog windows is now white and no longer changes to show a custom brand color setting .
for example , this change can be seen when in edit and create windows or in the windows that open when selecting any action from the action bar .
this change gives your users a visual indicator that they ’re performing an action as opposed to simply viewing information . •
the brand color  setting does n’t change the action bar or the action menu icon anymore .
( the action bar is available in the salesforce1 mobile browser app and the salesforce1 downloadable apps , versions 7.0 and later . )
this change gives you more flexibility in the color you can set as your brand color .
previously , if you used white as your brand color , the background of the action menu background .
icon assumed this color and consequently “ disappeared ” against the action bar ’s white 116 salesforce spring ’15 release notes salesforce1 enhancements in this release

open most salesforce urls directly in a salesforce1 downloadable app the salesforce1 downloadable app for android , version 7.2 now supports url schemes , same as the salesforce1 for ios app .
when a user taps a salesforce url hyperlink , or enters a salesforce url into a browser address bar on a mobile device , she ’s taken directly to that page in salesforce1 .
this saves users from having to manually navigate to desired information in the app .
for example , a user can email a salesforce url for an account to some coworkers .
simply by tapping the link in the email , a coworker using a salesforce1 downloadable app can automatically open the account record in the app .
an administrator or developer can customize a url scheme to perform a specific action when salesforce1 launches . see salesforce1 mobile url schemes for more information .

other search enhancements see more relevant search results for people and groups prior to spring ’15 , salesforce1 returned search results for people or groups whose names started with the search term .
only the name  field was searched .
now all versions of the salesforce1 app find people and groups that contain all of the words in the search term within any of the fields on these objects .
but matches on the name  field are ranked as more relevant than other matching fields .
for example , a user searching for customer support  sees results for a group named “
customer support , ” as well as a group with “ we support our customers ” in the group ’s description .
search group feeds all salesforce1 users can now search group feeds to quickly find posts , comments , and files in a group . other relationship and data management enhancements create contacts

now you can control whether and when you allow users to create duplicate records inside salesforce ; customize the logic that ’s used to identify duplicates ; and create reports on the duplicates you do allow users to save .

also , check out the video : understanding matching rules ( 4:32 ) .
key improvements from the winter ’15 beta release • custom objects are supported by duplicate rules and matching rules . •
cross - object matching is supported by duplicate rules .
for example , set up a rule so that when users attempt to save contact records , they ’ll see a list of possible duplicate contacts and leads . •
when your duplicate rules are set up to match across objects , you can decide how the matching rule fields map to each other .
for example , you might map the account name  field for a contact to the company  name for a lead . •
when your matching rule includes custom fields , you can decide how the fields map to each other .
for example , you might map a custom field called work email  to the standard email  field . •
you can use fields with picklist values in your custom matching rules . •
we ’ve improved how duplicate rules work when converting leads .
if your organization has the “ use apex lead convert ” permission and a user converts a lead to a new or existing contact or account , the action specified in the duplicate rule will determine whether the lead can be converted . •
we ’ve improved how duplicate rules work with data.com .
now , if your organization uses data.com and the data.com duplicate preference option is set to allow duplicate records to be added from data.com : – the action specified in the duplicate rule will determine whether the user can add the record . –
users can click save ( ignore alert ) on the comparison page when manually cleaning a record to ignore duplicate alerts and save the record .
147 salesforce spring ’15 release notes duplicate management ( generally available ) • we ’ve added a bunch of new apis and apex classes for duplicate management .
see the api and apex sections of these release notes for more information .
duplicate management limitations • duplicate management is available for accounts , contacts , leads , and custom objects .
all other objects , including opportunities and person accounts , are not currently supported .
• duplicate rules do n’t run when records are created in following ways . –
when records are created using quick create . –
when leads are converted to accounts or contacts and  your organization does n’t have the “
use apex lead convert ” permission . –
when a record is restored with the undelete button . –
when records are added using exchange sync . –
when records are manually merged . •
in some cases , if duplicate rules are set for an alert to show when potential duplicates are found , users will always be blocked from saving records and will not see a list of possible duplicates .
examples of this include the following . –
when records are added using the data import tools . –
when a person account is converted to a business account ( and the newly created business account matches existing business accounts ) . –
when records are added or edited using salesforce apis . • standard and custom matching rules that use fuzzy matching methods only support latin characters , and , if you ’re using international data , we recommend you use the exact matching method with your matching rules . •
if a field on an object is no longer available to your organization , it may cause matching rules with mappings to this field to be ignored .
this could affect your duplicate detection .
make sure you check all duplicate rule field mappings for an object if there is a change to the fields available to your organization .
for example , the clean status  field is only available to customers with a data.com license .
if your organization no longer has a data.com license , this field is no longer available and matching rules with mappings to this field will be ignored . •
the customizable alert text in duplicate rules is n’t supported by the translation workbench .

note :  the modified date  field in this related list tells the last time the user territory association record was modified .

154 salesforce spring ’15 release notes let all forecast users adjust their own forecasts with flexible forecast adjustments for information about setting up specific custom reports that we recommend for effective territory management , check out the salesforce help or implementing enterprise territory management . let all forecast users adjust their own forecasts with flexible forecast adjustments collaborative forecasts continues to get better .
reps now have the power to make adjustments to their own forecasts without changing the underlying opportunity value .
and sales managers can save time by adjusting the rolled up forecast number instead of each individual forecast number for every rep .
editions available in : professional ( no opportunity splits or custom field forecasts ) , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions forecast adjustments make forecasting more flexible by allowing users to make changes to forecast rollup amounts .
this lets users adapt their forecasts to revenue or quantity changes they foresee that are not yet reflected in the rollup .
for example , forecast managers may have sales reps who report to them who consistently under- or over - estimate the final amounts of their opportunities .
these managers can adjust those subordinates’ forecast amounts to account for these anticipated discrepancies .
now in spring ’15 , administrators can allow all forecast users , including both sales reps and managers , to adjust their own forecast amounts .
this broader adjustment capability lets users adapt their forecasts in more situations .
for example , if a manager anticipates that final revenue amounts will be higher than the current forecast , but they are n’t sure which of their subordinates will be responsible for the difference , they can adjust their own best case forecast amount rather than adjusting an individual subordinate ’s forecast .
similarly , if a sales rep anticipates that her commit forecast amount will come in higher , but is n’t sure which opportunities will provide the additional revenue , she can adjust her own commit forecast amount .
sales managers can only adjust their forecast totals , not the subtotal for my opportunities .
155 salesforce spring ’15 release notes products now have field history tracking keep in mind that adding an adjustment does n't change the underlying gross rollup of opportunities — it just adds a layer of detail , which can be changed or removed later .
note :  if your organization uses product family forecasts , users ca n’t adjust their own product family forecast amounts .

organization sync uses the framework of salesforce to salesforce , a feature that lets customers share records with other companies that use salesforce .
to set up organization sync , you ’ll establish a secondary salesforce organization with matching metadata and create a data replication connection between the primary and secondary organizations .
you can specify which types of data are copied to the secondary organization by mapping essential objects and fields to the secondary organization through a publish and subscribe process .
then , records are copied to the secondary organization in a way that ensures that they remain synced .
when the primary organization is unavailable , users are redirected to the secondary organization until the maintenance is complete .
nearly all actions ( creating a case , deleting an attachment , and more ) that users perform in one organization are automatically applied to the other organization .
to learn more about organization sync , contact salesforce .

198 salesforce spring ’15 release notes more collaboration options in chatter groups allow users to add records to chatter groups adding records to groups allows users to collaborate on and discuss the records as a team in the group .
the ability to add records to groups is enabled by default , but you need to configure the group publisher before users can use this feature . 1 .
from setup , click customize > chatter > settings .
in the groups section , verify that allow records in groups is selected . 2 .
customize the group layout and add the add record action to the group publisher .
3 .
we recommend that you customize object layouts to include the groups related list on record detail pages .
do this for all the standard and custom objects in your organization that support group - record relationships .
the groups list allows users to view the list of groups that a record is associated with .
a few things to bear in mind about adding records to groups : • groups that allow customers and groups in communities do n’t support records in groups . •
users can add account , contact , lead , opportunity , contract , campaign , case , and custom object records to groups .
other objects are n’t supported .
editions enterprise available in : • group •
professional • • performance • unlimited • contact manager • developer user permissions to enable records in chatter groups : • “ customize application ” •
users must have permissions to access the record as well as the group . •
users can add any number of records to a group . •
adding a record to a group does n’t affect the group feed , record feed , or record visibility ( sharing ) .
no feed items are created ; only a confirmation message appears .
the group does n’t follow the record , or vice versa .
• only users with the necessary permissions ( via license , profile , permission sets , or sharing ) can see the records in a group .
for example , chatter free users do n’t see any records in groups .
or , a user with permissions to view accounts and contacts ca n’t view any case records in the group .
this sometimes means that users see fewer records than the actual count indicated on the group records list .
• records can be added to groups using the salesforce soap api or the chatter rest api .
group - record relationships are stored in the collaborationgrouprecord  object .
group records are supported in both the soap api and the chatter rest api .
group posts via email now support non - unique email addresses starting in spring ’15 , chatter groups support posts via email from non - unique email addresses in your organization , as long as they ’re unique at the group level .
previously , email addresses shared by more than one user record were blocked from posting to groups .
going forward , posts from such email addresses will not be blocked .
of the multiple user records an email address is associated with , posts to the group feed display as posted by the user record that is also a member of the group .
if multiple user records that share email addresses are members in the same group , then posts from that email address to that group are blocked . unlisted group enhancements you can now convert unlisted groups to public or private groups when you want to open them up to a wider audience .
we ’ve also changed the access limitations for some users . •
users with the “ manage unlisted groups ” can now delete feed content without requiring the “
modify all data ” permission . 199 salesforce spring ’15 release notes files • users with the “
modify

in
this section : actions terminology changed we ’ve changed the names of a few action types in our documentation and in the salesforce user interface so that you ’ll see terminology that accurately describes them . delegated administrators can manage public groups now delegated administrators can create public groups , and you can specify public groups in which delegated administrators can add and remove users in specified roles and all subordinate roles .
this way , you can delegate public group management tasks while maintaining strict control over which public groups delegated administrators can manage .
permission for managing custom permissions changed the permission that ’s required for creating , editing , and deleting custom permissions is now “ manage custom permissions . ”
now organizations that want more precise control over their administrators’ user - management permissions can grant this permission instead of “ customize application . ”
create or edit records owned by inactive users you do n’t have to reactivate a user to update certain records owned by the inactive user .
search for additional items in setup ( beta ) use advanced setup search to find the items that you need quickly , without having to click repeatedly through menus and page links , such as a specific custom link .
with spring ’15 , we ’ve expanded the list of individual setup items that you can search for by name from setup .
you can now search for assignment rules , custom buttons , and custom links .
212 salesforce spring ’15 release notes general administration availability of compound fields in formula functions changed you could previously use address and geolocation compound fields in all formula expressions , but unhandled exceptions would often result .
compound fields have been enabled in the isnull , isblank , and ischanged  functions , and have been blocked in several other functions , so that you do n’t encounter these errors .
standard address fields show google maps records with standard address fields now display a google maps image of the address .
this saves users time by letting them see where their contacts or accounts are located , instead of having to locate addresses in a separate browser tab .
limitations changed for geolocation fields ( generally available ) geolocation fields , formerly available only as a beta release , are now generally available .
now you can get the most out of geolocation thanks to fewer limitations and increased functionality , including improvements in visual workflow , workflow updates and approvals , apex , search tools , and more .
indexed column added to lists of fields in setup listings of fields in setup include a new indexed column that indicates when a field is indexed in the database .
we recommend that filter conditions in reports , list views , and soql queries target indexed fields for better response time .
actions terminology changed we ’ve changed the names of a few action types in our documentation and in the salesforce user interface so that you ’ll see terminology that accurately describes them .
publisher actions are now quick actions throughout the salesforce and salesforce1 user interface and documentation , we ’ve renamed the term publisher action to quick action .
with the recent uncoupling of actions from their reliance on chatter and its publisher , the term publisher action no longer accurately described these types of actions .
they ’ve been known as quick actions in the salesforce api from their inception , and so we decided to use that term consistently everywhere .
the publisher actions section of the page layout editor is now actions in the publisher as a result of the publisher action terminology change , we renamed the actions section in the enhanced page layout editor and across all global publisher layouts .
the enable publisher actionschatter organization preference is now enable actions in the publisher we renamed the chatter organization preference for actions in the publisher , located in setup at customize > chatter > settings .
record actions are now productivity actions throughout the salesforce and salesforce1 user interface and documentation , we ’ve renamed the term record action to productivity action .
these actions , which appear only in salesforce1 , include send email ( ) , log a call ( ) , map ( ) , view website ( ) , and read news ( events in salesforce today . ) .
productivity actions are available on accounts , contacts , leads , opportunities , person accounts , and mobile calendar 213 salesforce spring ’15 release notes general administration delegated administrators can manage public groups now delegated administrators can create public groups , and you can specify public groups in which delegated administrators can add and remove users in specified roles and all subordinate roles .

for more information , see “
delegate public group management ” in the salesforce help .
permission for managing custom permissions changed the permission that ’s required for creating , editing , and deleting custom permissions is now “
manage custom permissions . ”
now organizations that want more precise control over their administrators’ user - management permissions can grant this permission instead of “ customize application . ”
in earlier releases , the “
customize application ” user permission was required for managing custom permissions .
the “
customize application ” permission still exists and provides the same access that it has provided in earlier releases .
when “
customize application ” is enabled , “
manage custom permissions ” is automatically enabled .
create or edit records owned by inactive users you do n’t have to reactivate a user to update certain records owned by the inactive user .
previously , only administrators were able to edit accounts , opportunities , and custom object records that are owned by inactive users .
with spring ’15 , administrators and all users with the create or edit permission can create or edit accounts , opportunities , and custom object records that are owned by inactive users .
for example , you can edit the account name field on an opportunity record that is owned by an inactive user .
search for additional items in setup ( beta ) use advanced setup search to find the items that you need quickly , without having to click repeatedly through menus and page links , such as a specific custom link .
with spring ’15 , we ’ve expanded the list of individual setup items that you can search for by name from setup .
you can now search for assignment rules , custom buttons , and custom links .
note : • advanced setup search is in beta .
it is production quality but has known limitations . •
after spring ’15 is available for your organization , it might take a few weeks before your organization ’s setup data is indexed and searchable .
during those initial weeks , searches might not return all possible results .

compound fields have been enabled in the isnull , isblank , and ischanged  functions , and have been blocked in several other functions , so that you do n’t encounter these errors .
editions available in all editions the following have been blocked from using compound fields . •
blankvalue • case • nullvalue 215 salesforce spring ’15 release notes general administration • priorvalue •
the comparison and equality operators : =  and = =  ( equal ) , < > and !
=  ( not equal ) , <  ( less than ) , >  ( greater than ) , < =  ( less than or equal ) , > =  ( greater than or equal ) , & &  ( and ) , and || ( or ) when you edit formulas that contain these blocked expressions , you ca n’t save your changes until you ’ve removed any blocked expressions that use compound fields .
but , any formulas that use compound fields in these blocked expressions almost certainly are n’t working .
for more information on compound fields , see “ compound field considerations and limitations ” in the soap api developer 's guide .
standard address fields show google maps records with standard address fields now display a google maps image of the address .
this saves users time by letting them see where their contacts or accounts are located , instead of having to locate addresses in a separate browser tab .
on a record , go to the detail page to see the google maps image on the address field .
to generate a map image , an address must include the street and city fields and either the state , postal code , or the country .
if an address field is missing any of the required information , a map wo n’t display .
the map image on the address is static , but clicking the map image opens google maps in a new browser tab .
maps on standard address fields are enabled by default .
to disable maps for your organization , from setup in the full salesforce site , click customize > maps and locations > settings and uncheck enable maps and location services .
limitations changed for geolocation fields ( generally available ) geolocation fields , formerly available only as a beta release , are now generally available .
now you can get the most out of geolocation thanks to fewer limitations and increased functionality , including improvements in visual workflow , workflow updates and approvals , apex , search tools , and more .
editions available in all editions spring ’15 includes the following changes to geolocation field limitations .
• geolocation fields are available in visual workflow and in formula - based criteria in workflow rules and approval processes , but can not be used in filter - based criteria in workflow rules and approval processes .
• geolocation fields can be searched in soql and sosl . •
distance  formulas are supported in : – entry criteria for workflow rules and approval processes – field update actions in workflow rules and approval processes – custom validation rules 216 salesforce spring ’15 release notes data •
the only formula functions that you can use with compound fields are isblank , ischanged , and isnull .
you ca n’t use blankvalue , case , nullvalue , priorvalue , or the equality and comparison operators with compound fields .
the equality and comparison operators include =  and = =  ( equal ) , < > and ! =  ( not equal ) , <  ( less than ) , >  ( greater than ) , < =  ( less than or equal ) , > =  ( greater than or equal ) , & &  ( and ) , and || ( or ) . • geolocation fields are now queryable in apex .
however , their locations are editable in apex only as components of the compound field . read and set geolocation field components by appending “ _
_
latitude__s ” or “ _ _
longitude__s ” to the field name , instead of the usual “
_ _ c . ”
for example : double thelatitude = myobject__c.alocation__latitude__s ; myobject__c.alocation__longitude__s = thelongitude ; for a full list of limitations , see “ geolocation custom field overview ” in the salesforce help .
indexed column added to lists of fields in setup listings of fields in setup include a new indexed column that indicates when a field is indexed in the database .
we recommend that filter conditions in reports , list views , and soql queries target indexed fields for better response time .
the new column is available for standard and custom objects and indicates indexing for standard and custom fields .
editions available in all editions optimizing the performance of filter conditions and soql queries , as on any database system , is as much art as science .
before you begin a custom indexing adventure , keep the following in mind . •
more indexes are n’t necessarily better . •
not every index improves performance . •
if you have fewer than 100,000 records to be queried , you probably do n’t need an index .
see the query & search optimization cheat sheet  for more specific details and tips .
if you think a custom index might improve the performance of your reports or soql queries , see the salesforce knowledge article “ custom indexing ” for details on how to get started .

enterprise retain field history with field audit trail ( generally available ) field audit trail lets you define a policy to retain archived field history data up to ten years , independent of field history tracking .
this feature helps you comply with industry regulations related to audit capability and data retention .
as part of a larger initiative for compliance essentials , salesforce is releasing field audit trail for general availability ( ga ) .
note :  you may need to purchase additional services or subscriptions to use this feature .
for pricing details , please contact your salesforce account executive .
use salesforce metadata api to define a retention policy for your field history .
then use rest api , soap api , and tooling api to work with your archived data .
for information about enabling field audit trail , contact your salesforce representative . field history is copied from the history related list into the fieldhistoryarchive  object and then deleted from the history related list .
you define one historyretentionpolicy  object for your related history lists , such as account history , to specify field audit trail retention policies for the objects that you want to archive .
you can then deploy the object by using the metadata api ( workbench or force migration tool ) .
in production organizations that have field audit trail enabled , data is archived by default after 18 months .
in sandbox organizations , the default is one month .
you can update the retention policies as often as you like .
after you define and deploy a field audit trail policy , production data is migrated from related history lists such as account history into the fieldhistoryarchive  object .
the first copy writes the field history that ’s defined by your policy to archive storage and sometimes takes a long time .
subsequent copies transfer only the changes since the last copy and are much faster .
a bounded set of soql is available to query your archived data .
note :
for some time after the initial ga release , data might not be automatically deleted from the history related list and may reside in both the fieldhistoryarchive  object and in the history related list .
salesforce reserves the right to delete archived data from the history related list in accordance with the customer - defined policy in future releases .
to learn more , see the field history retention implementation guide .

editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer each connection to your customer drives an ever - increasing scale of data .
this growth demands a new set of tools , and the data pipelines pilot enables highly scalable batch processing , transformation , and understanding of customer data .
as apex enables developers to control and execute flow and transaction control , data pipelines offers a complementary tool set for data flow control .
this tool set ia based on apache pig , a broadly used and high - level language for expressing data flow control , along with 220 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation a set of functions to help evaluate data .
pig offers an abstraction on top of the salesforce hadoop infrastructure to permit mapreduce processing within the context of the established salesforce multitenant architecture .
data pipelines jobs are expressed as pig latin scripts that are deployed to your organization by using mechanisms that are familiar to the salesforce developer community ( the metadata api and the tooling api ) .
data pipelines supports apache pig 0.13 distribution and apache datafu 1.2.0 , and delivers a whitelisted set of apache datafu and piggybank udf libraries to broaden the computational expressiveness for a comprehensive set of use cases .

changes since the beta if you ’re already familiar with the lightning process builder , check out the new features we added in spring ’15 .
now you can create versions of a process , call apex , customize condition logic , and more .
221 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation visual workflow spring ’15 has unlocked a bunch of functionality for flow administrators and users .
among other things , you can enable your users to pause flow interviews , customize the condition logic that ’s used in decision and wait elements , and more .
we should also mention that what you used to know as “ trigger - ready ” flows are now called
“ autolaunched

visually automate your business processes ( generally available )
now generally available , the lightning process builder is a workflow tool that helps you easily automate everything from daily tasks , like follow - up emails , to more complex processes , like order renewals and new - hire onboarding .
in just a few clicks you can automate business processes and help your organization operate more efficiently .
note :  the process builder is not available in the spring ’15 pre - release program .
the process builder ’s simple and powerful design allows you to : • create your processes by using a convenient visual layout with point - and - click efficiency •
create your whole process in one place rather than using multiple workflow rules • create processes by collaborating with different teams in your business • stop using apex code to automate simple tasks editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer you can use the more powerful and flexible process builder to perform the same actions as workflow .
the process builder does n't have a specific outbound message action , but you can create and fully customize your outbound messages using process builder 's new “
call apex ” action .
with the process builder , you can : • create a record • update any related record — not just the record or its parent • use a quick action to create a record , update a record , or log a call • trigger an autolaunched flow — from immediate and also scheduled actions • send an email • post to chatter • submit a record for approval if you need your process to do more than what those actions allow , do n’t worry .
you can also call apex from a process
. 222 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation with the process builder , it ’s easy to get started creating automated business processes .
for example , you can create automated processes that : • update all the mailing addresses on all child contacts when a billing address is changed on an account . •
submit a record for approval without requiring users to submit manually .
• create records and notifications based on stages of an opportunity and schedule follow - up tasks that execute based on changes to records .
• create an order record with the data in the opportunity and associated account when the opportunity stage changes to closed and won . •
send an email reminder to the account team if a high - value opportunity is still open ten days before the specified close date .
process builder —
changes since the beta if you ’re already familiar with the lightning process builder , check out the new features we added in spring ’15 .
now you can create versions of a process , call apex , customize condition logic , and more .
note :  the process builder is not available in the spring ’15 pre - release program .
in
this section : editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer create versions of a process easily track , maintain , and optimize your business processes without having to rebuild an entire process from scratch with the process builder ’s new versioning capability .
call an apex method from a process when no other process action can get the job done , add customized functionality to your salesforce processes by calling an apex method . 223 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation trigger a process multiple times in a single transaction make your automated processes even more efficient by reevaluating a record multiple times in a single transaction .
determine whether specific fields changed it ’s now easier in a process ’s criteria to determine whether specific fields on a record changed .
we are deprecating the ischanged formula function and replacing it with the is changed operator .
this operator is available for filter conditions .
customize the condition logic in process builder you ’re no longer limited to using the same logic between all of the conditions for a given criteria in the process builder .
just like with reports and workflow criteria , you can now customize the logic .
create and manage processes more efficiently we ’ve updated the process builder to make it more usable .
now you can view and sort your processes , expand and collapse actions , and more .
other changes in the process builder learn about other enhancements in the process builder .
create versions of a process easily track , maintain , and optimize your business processes without having to rebuild an entire process from scratch with the process builder ’s new versioning capability .
now if you want to make changes to an existing process , just clone it .
you can save the clone as a new process with its own version history or as a new version of the current process .
while a given process can have up to 50 versions , only one of those versions can be active .
if you want the clone to run concurrently with the original process , use the clone to create a completely new process .
you do n't have to deactivate the first process in order to activate the clone .
if you want to make changes to the clone and use it to replace the original process , save the clone as a new version of the original process .
when you activate the new version , the previously active version is automatically deactivated .
call an apex method from a process when no other process action can get the job done , add customized functionality to your salesforce processes by calling an apex method .
to call an apex method , add the call apex action to your process and select an apex class with an invocable method .
it ’s that easy .
if the class contains one or more invocable variables , manually enter values or reference field values from a related record .
each value must match the variable ’s data type .
trigger a process multiple times in a single transaction make your automated processes even more efficient by reevaluating a record multiple times in a single transaction .
previously , when a record changed , the process always evaluated it with the specified criteria and executed an action group only once .
this means that if another process , workflow rule , or flow changed the record , the process would n’t immediately evaluate the criteria again and would n’t apply to any changes made by other processes .
now your processes can ( optionally ) evaluate the same record up to five additional times if another process , workflow rule , or flow updates the record in the same transaction .
when you choose an object and specify when to start the process , you are asked if you want to allow process to evaluate a record multiple times in a single transaction ? .
select yes to allow the process to reevalute a record multiple times .
224 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation determine whether specific fields changed it ’s now easier in a process ’s criteria to determine whether specific fields on a record changed .
we are deprecating the ischanged formula function and replacing it with the is changed operator .
this operator is available for filter conditions .
existing active processes continue to work with the ischanged  formula function , but you ca n’t clone the process .
similarly , you ca n’t make changes to existing inactive processes that use the ischanged  formula function .
instead , use the is changed operator in a filter condition .
customize the condition logic in process builder you ’re no longer limited to using the same logic between all of the conditions for a given criteria in the process builder .
just like with reports and workflow criteria , you can now customize the logic .
to customize the condition logic for a criteria node in a process , select customize the filter logic .
example :  in an opportunity process , you want to execute an action group if a high value deal is won .
the criteria checks whether the opportunity stage is won .
in addition , you want to check whether the opportunity is either greater than $ 1,000,000 or in an emerging market . you can use three criteria conditions and customize the condition logic to be 1 and ( 2 or 3 ) .
create and manage processes more efficiently we ’ve updated the process builder to make it more usable .
now you can view and sort your processes , expand and collapse actions , and more .
sort your list of processes
from the updated process management page , you can sort your processes by name , description , object , last modified date , or status .
expand and collapse actions on the canvas sometimes you do n’t want to see all the details of a process .
now you can expand or collapse actions on the process builder ’s canvas with the new expand all and collapse all buttons .
see what you ’re editing on the canvas when you open a node on the canvas , that node is highlighted with a blue border so you always know what you ’re working on
. 225 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation process status simplified we ’ve deprecated three of the possible statuses for processes : draft , obsolete , and invaliddraft .
instead , processes are either active or inactive .
if an existing process is set to draft , obsolete , or invaliddraft , the status will be updated to inactive .
find and enter values
more easily previously , when you entered values , you could n’t see a list of all available options .
now , when you enter values , you can either : • type to search for a specific value •
click next to the field to browse all available options the names of values now appear as field labels instead of unique api names .
use multi - select picklist fields
previously , you could n't select multiple values for any fields .
now you can do so for fields that accept more than one value .
for example , if an action creates a record and the record has a multi - select field , you can select multiple values for the multi - select field .
get more information
when you ’re getting started when you start using the process builder and have no processes , the process management page now displays some helpful links .
226 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation other changes in the process builder learn about other enhancements in the process builder .
spaces no longer required in formula functions previously , you had to include a space between a function ’s parenthesis and the contents of the parenthesis , for example : text ( [ account].lastmodifieddate ) .
you no longer need to include these spaces .
create more actions you are no longer limited to 10 immediate actions and 10 scheduled actions for a given criteria node .
deploy processes you can now deploy processes using change sets , packages , and the metadata api .
for change sets and packages , processes are flow component types .
to deploy a process using the metadata api , you must create a flow of type workflow .
namespaced organizations supported processes are supported in organizations with a registered namespace so your processes can now be saved and added to managed packages .
navigate more easily with field tooltips
previously , the only way to see tooltips on fields was to hover over the tooltips appear every time you focus on an input field that has tooltips . .
now , when navigating the process builder with a keyboard , visual workflow spring ’15 has unlocked a bunch of functionality for flow administrators and users .
among other things , you can enable your users to pause flow interviews , customize the condition logic that ’s used in decision and wait elements , and more .
we should also mention that what you used to know as “ trigger - ready ” flows are now called
“ autolaunched
” flows .
in
this section : let users pause flow interviews with a little bit of setup , you can enable your users to pause their flows .
a user might pause a flow when a call gets dropped or a customer needs to find her account number and call back .
users can resume the interview when it ’s time to proceed .
an interview is a running instance of a flow .
customize the condition logic in flows you ’re no longer limited to using the same logic between all of the conditions for a given outcome or wait event in a flow .
just like with reports and workflow criteria , you can now customize the logic . editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer user permissions to open , edit , or create a flow in the cloud flow designer : • “ manage force.com flow ”
create a dynamic label for flow interviews depending on how frequently your users start a given flow , the same flow can have multiple interviews running at the same time .
make it easier for administrators and users alike to tell the difference between those interviews by customizing interview label , a new flow property .
give flows access to apex classes
more easily for things that the out - of - the - box flow elements ca n’t handle , configure an apex class to make it available from a flow .
previously , you could use the cumbersome process .
plugin  interface .
now , there ’s a better , simpler way : the @invocablemethod annotation . 227 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation trigger - ready flows renamed to autolaunched flows we ’ve changed the name of trigger - ready flows in our documentation and in the salesforce user interface to more accurately describe their functionality . identify a flow ’s type you can now identify what type of flow you want to create when you save , rather than having to decode the run restrictions column on the flow management or detail pages .
get more information about waiting interviews last release , we added a list to the flow management page , where you can monitor interviews that are waiting for events .
in this release , we updated the list view and the interview record detail page to display more information about those interviews .
reference the id of a chatter post that a flow created if you create chatter posts in a flow , you can now use the created feed item ’s id later in that flow .
for example , provide the user with a link to the new feed item .
assign feed item id  to a flow variable when you configure the “ post to chatter ”
element .
reference information from an approval request that a flow submitted if you submit an approval request in a flow , you can now use information from the approval request later in that flow .
for example , use the approval request ’s status in a decision element .
assign the approval request ’s outputs to flow variables when you configure the submit for approval element .
assign an event ’s outputs to flow variables if you ’ve created a time - based flow , you can now use information from the event that the flow waited for later in that flow .
for example , the actual time at which the event occurred .
change in activation date for “ enable governor limits on all executed flows ”
critical update salesforce issued a critical update in the summer ’14 release , available in the critical update console ( cruc ) , titled “
enable governor limits on all executed flows .
” this critical update originally had an auto - activation date of 1/11/2015 .
in order to give customers and partners more time to validate and resolve issues that have arisen from this change , the auto - activation date has been postponed until the summer ’15 release : 4/15/2015 .
other changes in visual workflow
in addition to the major enhancements , here are some other enhancements that make it easier to work with flows .
these enhancements include predefined names for default connectors , new events for troubleshooting flows , and more .
let users pause flow interviews with a little bit of setup , you can enable your users to pause their flows .
a user might pause a flow when a call gets dropped or a customer needs to find her account number and call back .
users can resume the interview when it ’s time to proceed .
an interview is a running instance of a flow .
if the user has partially filled out a screen when she pauses the interview , that information is saved with the interview .
so when she resumes later , she does n’t have to fill in that information again , so long as the values were valid .
if any values were invalid , those values are n’t saved with the interview .
note :  if your flow executes any elements before a pausable screen , make sure it ’s appropriate for a time delay to occur between those elements and the elements after a pausable screen .
a new transaction starts at each screen .
when the previous transaction is closed , any actions in the flow ’s path before that screen are performed .
for example , this flow executes a screen element , a post to chatter element , a pausable screen element , and then a record create element .
user permissions to configure a flow ’s screens in the cloud flow designer : • “ manage force.com flow ”
to edit workflow and approval settings , create or change home page layouts , or customize salesforce1 navigation : • “ customize application ”
228 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation if a user pauses at the second screen , the chatter post is created before the user sees the second screen .
after the user resumes the interview and clicks finish , the record is created .
the flow does n’t defer all actions and perform them when the flow finishes .
depending on how long before the user resumes , the record could be created well after the chatter post . 1 .
configure each flow screen that you want users to be able to pause from .
a. select show pause button .
b. in pause message , provide a confirmation message so that your users know the interview was successfully paused .
we recommend : you ’ve paused this interview .
when you ’re ready to continue , resume the interview from paused flow interviews on your home tab or in salesforce1 . 2 .
3 .
in that flow ’s properties , customize the interview label .
in your workflow and approvals settings , select let users pause flows .
if this setting is disabled , pause buttons never display in any flows .
4 . let your users easily resume their paused interviews .
a. add paused flow interviews to your users’ home tab page layouts .
b. add flow
interviews to your organization ’s salesforce1 navigation menu .
for details , see “
designing home tab page layouts ” and “ customize the salesforce1 navigation menu ” in the salesforce help .
only the user who paused the flow or an administrator can resume or delete a paused interview .

debug paused and resumed interviews we ’ve added new debug log messages to help you troubleshoot flow interviews that users have paused or resumed .
new debugging messages are available when you allow users to pause , and later resume , flow interviews .
to help you trace what occurs when users pause and resume flows , the following events are available in the workflow category of debug logs when the level logged is set to info and above . •
flow_interview_paused •
flow_interview_resumed customize the condition logic in flows you ’re no longer limited to using the same logic between all of the conditions for a given outcome or wait event in a flow .
just like with reports and workflow criteria , you can now customize the logic .
to customize the condition logic for a wait event or an outcome in a decision , select advanced logic ( combination of ands and ors ) .
example :  in an employee survey , you want the flow to take a certain path depending on the choices a user makes on a screen .
the user must have indicated that they bike to work .
in addition , the user must have selected either technology or customer support as their department . instead of using multiple decisions to evaluate those two requirements , you can use one decision and customize the outcome ’s condition logic to be 1 and ( 2 or 3 ) .

230 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation create a dynamic label for flow interviews depending on how frequently your users start a given flow , the same flow can have multiple interviews running at the same time .
make it easier for administrators and users alike to tell the difference between those interviews by customizing interview label , a new flow property .
administrators see interview label  in the paused and waiting interviews list on the flow management page .
end users see interview label in the paused flow interviews component on the home tab and the paused flow interviews item in salesforce1 .
the interview label for new flows is prepopulated with  flowname - { !
$ flow .
currentdatetime}. if you open an existing flow and place your cursor in the description or interview label fields , the same value is prepopulated in interview label .
to customize the interview label , open a new flow and click save or open an existing flow and click .
tip :  use a text template to reference additional information , like the contact associated with the flow interview .
example :  the interview label  for this flow is set to a text template called { !
mycustominterviewlabel }  that contains customer satisfcation survey 2014 - { ! account .

more easily for things that the out - of - the - box flow elements ca n’t handle , configure an apex class to make it available from a flow .
previously , you could use the cumbersome process .
plugin  interface .
now , there ’s a better , simpler way : the @invocablemethod  annotation .
here ’s a quick comparison between the two ways that you can make a class available from a flow .
process .
plugin interface @invocablemethod annotation user permissions to configure a “ call apex ” element : • “ manage force.com flow ” apex data type support does n’t support : • blob • collection • sobject •
time does n’t support : • generic object • generic sobject • sets • maps • enums the cloud flow designer does n’t support mapping an apex method ’s input or output parameters to an sobject collection variable .
bulk operations not supported supported 232 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation process .
plugin interface class name or the value of the name property .
@invocablemethod annotation class name classes with this interface implemented are available in flows classes with this annotation implemented are available in : • flows • processes •
rest api apex plug - in or the value of the tag  property .
apex passing data to a flow using the process .
plugin  interface invocablemethod annotation and invocablevariable annotation element name in the cloud flow designer reusability section in the cloud flow designer more details in the force.com apex code developer ’s guide
once you have made an apex method invocable , that method ’s class appears in the cloud flow designer ’s palette under the call apex section .
to call one of those classes from a flow , simply drag the class onto the canvas and configure the element that appears .
example :  to illustrate the difference between these two implementation methods , here are two classes that do the same thing : get an account name from a flow and return that account ’s id .
this class implements the @invocablemethod annotation .
global class lookupaccountannotation { @invocablemethod public static list < string > getaccountids(list < string > names ) { list < id > accountids = new list < id > ( ) ; list < account > accounts = [ select i d from account where name in : names ] ; for ( account account : accounts ) { accountids.add(account .
id ) ; } return accountids ; } } this class implements the process .
plugin interface .
global class lookupaccountplugin implements process .
plugin { global process .
pluginresult invoke(process .
pluginrequest request ) { string name = ( string ) request.inputparameters.get('name ' ) ; account account = [ select i d from account where name = : name limit 1][0 ] ; map < string , object > result = new map < string , object > ( ) ; result.put('accountid ' , account .
id ) ; return new process .
pluginresult(result ) ; } 233 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation global process .
plugindescriberesult describe ( ) { process .
plugindescriberesult result = new process .
plugindescriberesult ( ) ; result .
name = ' look up account id by name ' ; result .
tag = ' account classes ' ; result.inputparameters = new list < process .
plugindescriberesult .

plugindescriberesult .
parametertype .
string ) } ; return result ; } } notice that lookupaccountannotation  is less than half the length ( 11 lines ) of lookupaccountplugin  ( 28 lines ) .
in addition , because the annotation supports bulk operations , lookupaccountannotation  performs one query per batch of interviews .
lookupaccountplugin  performs one query per interview .
trigger - ready flows renamed to autolaunched flows we ’ve changed the name of trigger - ready flows in our documentation and in the salesforce user interface to more accurately describe their functionality .
before spring ’15 , we referred to flows that do n’t require user interaction as trigger - ready flows , because the main method of launching these flows was a flow trigger .
but now you can launch flows that do n’t require user interaction in other ways , too .
trigger - ready flows are now called autolaunched flows .
identify a flow ’s type you can now identify what type of flow you want to create when you save , rather than having to decode the run restrictions  column on the flow management or detail pages .
to customize the type , open a new flow and click save or open an existing flow and click for a given flow , the versions do n’t have to have the same type .
it ’s okay to have some flow versions and some autolaunched flow versions for one flow . .
user permissions to customize a flow ’s type : • “ manage force.com flow ”
get more information about waiting interviews last release , we added a list to the flow management page , where you can monitor interviews that are waiting for events .
in this release , we updated the list view and the interview record detail page to display more information about those interviews .
changes to the list view you ’ll see the following changes on the list view on the flow management page .
to see the list view , from setup click create > workflow and approvals > flows .
renamed list view the list view ’s title is now “ paused and waiting interviews ” .
before , it was “ waiting interviews ” .
the list now displays interviews that were paused by end - users .
234 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation removed columns the following columns are no longer available in new custom list views .
if you added one or more of these columns to a custom list view before spring ’15 , those columns are available in the existing list view .
• interaction definition version id • definition added columns the following columns were added . •
type : the type for the flow that was run .
if the flow contains subflows , this is the master flow .
for details , see “ flow types ” in the salesforce help . •
current flow type : the type for the flow at which the interview is paused . •
interview label : dynamic text configured by the flow creator to differentiate multiple interviews of the same flow .
for details , see create a dynamic label for flow interviews on page 231 . • why paused : text entered by end - users when they pause flow interviews . •
current flow version : the version of the flow at which the interview is paused .
the “ current flow ” can differ from the “ flow ” if the flow references a subflow .
changed columns the following columns were changed . •
flow name : in spring ’15 , there were two columns named flow name .
in the list view , the one that corresponds to the current flow is now named current flow name . •
version : changed to flow version  to differentiate it from current flow version . •
created date : changed to paused date because the date / time value reflects when the flow interview started waiting .
• definition version :
in winter ’15 , there were two columns named definition version .
the one that corresponds to the flow that was run is now named flow version label .
the one that corresponds to the flow at which the interview is paused is now named current flow version label .
changes to the record detail page you ’ll see the following changes on the interview record detail page .
to see an interview record detail page , refer to the paused and waiting interviews list on the flow management page and click the link under name .
if the list does n’t include any interviews , run a flow that contains a wait element .
renamed object the object name for interview records is now flow interview .
previously , it was interaction interview .
removed field the definition version  field is no longer available from interview records .
added fields the following fields are now available on interview records .
• interview label • why paused • paused date added sections the following sections were added . •
current flow information — contains fields related to the flow at which the interview is paused .
if this information differs from what ’s in flow information , the interview was paused in a subflow .
235 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation • flow information — contains fields related to the flow that was run .
if this information differs from what ’s in current flow information , this is the master flow . •
system information added fields to current flow information the following fields were added to the current flow information section . •
flow name • version •
type • current element added fields to flow information the following fields were added to the flow information section . •
flow name • version •
type reference the id of a chatter post that a flow created if you create chatter posts in a flow , you can now use the created feed item ’s id later in that flow .
for example , provide the user with a link to the new feed item .
assign feed item id  to a flow variable when you configure the “ post to chatter ”
element .
reference information from an approval request that a flow submitted if you submit an approval request in a flow , you can now use information from the approval request later in that flow .
for example , use the approval request ’s status in a decision element . assign the approval request ’s outputs to flow variables when you configure the submit for approval element .
optional output parameter instance id instance status new work item ids next approver ids record id description the id of the approval process that was submitted for approval .
the status of the current approval process .
valid values are “
approved , ” “
rejected , ”
“ removed , ” or “
pending ” .
the ids of the new items submitted to the approval process .
there can be 0 or 1 approval processes .
the ids of the users who are assigned as the next approvers .
the id of the record that the flow submitted for approval .
user permissions to configure a “ post to chatter ” element : • “ manage force.com flow ”
user permissions to configure a “
submit for approval ” element : • “ manage force.com flow ”
236 salesforce spring ’15 release notes business logic and process automation user permissions to configure a “
wait ”
element : • “ manage force.com flow ”
assign an event ’s outputs to flow variables if you ’ve created a time - based flow , you can now use information from the event that the flow waited for later in that flow .
for example , the actual time at which the event occurred .
if you assign one of the following output parameters to flow variables , the variable is populated when the event occurs and the flow resumes .
parameter base time event delivery status example 11/26/2014 10:12 am delivered description the actual time at which the event occurred and the flow interview resumed .
the status of the event when the flow interview resumed .
after an event occurs , salesforce delivers the event to the flow that ’s waiting for it , so that the flow knows to resume .
valid values are : • delivered : the event was successfully delivered .
• invalid :
an error occurred during delivery , but the flow successfully resumed .
change in activation date for “ enable governor limits on all executed flows ”
critical update salesforce issued a critical update in the summer ’14 release , available in the critical update console ( cruc ) , titled “
enable governor limits on all executed flows .
” this critical update originally had an auto - activation date of 1/11/2015 .
in order to give customers and partners more time to validate and resolve issues that have arisen from this change , the auto - activation date has been postponed until the summer ’15 release : 4/15/2015 .
please ensure that your organization is tested and updated as needed in preparation for this activation , per the description in the critical update .
other changes in visual workflow
in addition to the major enhancements , here are some other enhancements that make it easier to work with flows .
these enhancements include predefined names for default connectors , new events for troubleshooting flows , and more .
add decision and wait elements to flows without configuring default connectors to help you build and distribute flows even faster , you no longer have to provide a name for default outcomes or paths .
default outcomes are configured in decision elements , and default paths are configured in wait elements .
the cloud flow designer provides a name automatically , but if the predefined name does n't work for your flow you can still change that value .
debug flow elements that were deferred at runtime salesforce defers bulk elements , such as record create elements , until all the flow interviews in the transaction have finished or reached a bulk element .
the new flow_element_deferred apex debug log event provides details about events that were deferred .
use date / time fields on additional objects to create a time - based flow by using a relative alarm event in a wait element , you can configure a flow to wait until a date / time value that ’s stored in a record .
you can now configure a relative alarm event to use a date / time field from : • feeditem 237 salesforce spring ’15 release notes security and identity • macroinstruction • metricdatalink • userprovaccount • userprovaccountstaging •
userprovmocktarget • userprovisioninglog • workfeedbacktemplate monitor a flow ’s type
instead of run restrictions we replaced the run restrictions  column on the flow management and flow detail pages with the type  column .
the run restrictions  column is no longer available in the default flow list view or in new custom flow list views .
if you created a list view before spring ’15 that uses the run restrictions  column , the column is still supported .
each type supports different elements and resources , as well as methods of implementing the flow .
see “
flow types ” in the salesforce help for details on the restrictions for each flow type .
user interface text updated for navigation options in winter ‘ 15 and earlier , you configured the buttons that appear on a screen via the navigation options picklist .
now that you can let users pause at a given screen , we made the following changes so that the navigation options support the new feature . •
the picklist is now in the navigation options section . •
the default value , which was “
no navigation restrictions ” , is now “ show finish and previous buttons ” .
security and identity use security to protect both your data and applications .
these features also provide user identity and access management .
in
this section : configure a google authentication provider let users log in to a salesforce organization using their google accounts .
set up an authentication provider
using salesforce - managed values when setting up a facebook , salesforce , linkedin , twitter , or google auth
. provider , you can choose to let salesforce automatically create key values .
previously , you could only set up an auth
. provider by providing values from your own third - party application or connected app .
this change allows you to skip the step of creating your own third - party application .
customize saml just - in - time user provisioning with an apex class you can use an apex class to control and customize just - in - time user provisioning logic during saml single sign - on .
previously , you could only provision users automatically based on attributes in the assertion .
you can now choose either method to provision users .
use multiple callback urls for connected apps you can now set more than one callback url  for a connected app .
previously , you could only set one callback url .
improve security with session domain locking use the lock sessions to the domain in which they were first used session settings option for strong prevention of unauthorized access from one domain to another .
edit authorize , token , and user info endpoints for facebook auth .
provider when you set up a facebook auth .
provider , you can now edit the authorize , token , and user info endpoint urls .
238 salesforce spring ’15 release notes security and identity get authentication configuration settings for a custom domain or community from a url the authentication configuration endpoint is a static page that can be used to query for information about an organization ’s saml for single sign - on and auth .
provider settings .
no session is required .
it ’s only available for salesforce communities or custom domains .
use this url when you ’re developing apps that need this information on demand .
create named credentials to define callout endpoints and their authentication settings a named credential specifies the url of a callout endpoint and its required authentication parameters in one definition .
you can simplify the setup of authenticated apex callouts by specifying a named credential as the callout endpoint .
doing so enables salesforce to securely handle all the authentication , so that you do n’t have to do so in your code .
you can also skip remote site settings , which are otherwise required for apex callouts to external sites .
track login history by id with session context the login history id is now associated with the sessions per login event .
this addition allows developers to create reports that track activities associated with multiple sessions for a single login event .
you can also track different login event information , such as browser type , operating system , and more , for a single session .
track data loader logins with login history you can now track data loader logins from the login history page or via the loginhistory object .
this addition enables you to more accurately monitor login attempts for your organization .
monitor your users’ login and logout activity ( generally available ) you can now use event monitoring to discover how often and at what times your users are logging in to and out of your organization .
this capability helps you discriminate between valid and invalid login requests and track user login patterns for future reference .
legitimize user activity using login forensics ( pilot ) use login forensics to identify unsual behavior within your organization , helping you prevent identity fraud and other security concerns .
sign saml single sign - on requests with rsa - sha256 you can sign outbound saml request assertions to an identity provider for single sign - on using the rsa - sha256 algorithm .
this enhancement provides stronger security than rsa - sha1 and interoperability with identity providers such as active directory federation services ( adfs ) .
choose the logout page for social sign - on users users who log in using social sign - on from providers like facebook and linkedin can now be directed to a specific logout destination that maintains your own branding experience or sent to a specific authentication provider ’s page .
monitor up to 180 days of identity provider events in log the identity provider event log now retains 180 days worth of events .
previously , it retained only 90 days worth of events .
provide code challenge and verifier values for oauth 2.0 web server flow
for nonce - based oauth 2.0 web server flows , you can specify an arbitrary code challenge value and a corresponding code verifier to help prevent authorization code interception attacks .
this feature is only supported in the oauth 2.0 web server authentication flow .
oauth 2.0 username - password flow error messages changed in the oauth 2.0 username - password flow , the error message for an invalid password , nonexistent username , or otherwise invalid credentials is now invalid_grant — authentication failure .
control individual api client access to your salesforce organization with api client whitelisting , restrict all api client applications , such as the data loader , to require administrator approval , unless the user ’s profile or permission set has the “ use any api client ” permission . 239 salesforce spring ’15 release notes security and identity provision users in third - party applications using connected apps ( beta ) configure connected apps with user provisioning to create , update , and delete user accounts in third - party applications based on users in your salesforce organization .
for your salesforce users , you canset up automatic account creation , updates , and deactivation for services such as google apps and box .
you can also discover existing user accounts in the third - party system and whether or not they are already linked to a salesforce user account .
clickjack label changed in session settings
in session settings , a clickjack protection label has been updated for additional clarity .
clickjack protection enabled for salesforce1 reporting for enhanced security , clickjack protection is now turned on by default for salesforce1 reporting , which includes the reports and dashboards tabs .
with clickjack protection enabled , be aware that the reports and dashboard tabs can no longer be embedded inside an iframe .
configure a google authentication provider let users log in to a salesforce organization using their google accounts .
to use google as an authentication provider : 1 .
set up a google application , making salesforce the application domain . 2 .
define a google authentication provider in your salesforce organization .
3 .
update your google application to use the callback url  generated by salesforce as the google website site url .
4 . test the connection .
set up a google application before you can configure google for your salesforce organization , you must set up an application in google : note :  you can skip this step by allowing salesforce to use its own default application .
for more information , see using salesforce - managed values in auth .

4 .
enter a name  for the provider .
240 salesforce spring ’15 release notes security and identity 5 .
enter the url suffix .
this is used in the client configuration urls .
for example , if the url suffix of your provider is “ mygoogleprovider ” , your single sign - on url is similar to : https://login.salesforce.com/auth/sso/00dx00000000001/mygoogleprovider .
6 .
use the application id from google for the consumer key  field .
7 .
use the application secret from google for the consumer secret field .
8 .
optionally , set the following fields .
a. default scopes  to send along with the request to the authorization endpoint .
otherwise , the hardcoded defaults for the provider type are used ( see google ’s developer documentation for these defaults ) .
for more information , see using the scope parameter .
b. custom error url  for the provider to use to report any errors . c. custom logout url  to provide a specific destination for users after they log out , if they authenticated using the single sign - on flow .
use this field to direct users to a branded logout page or destination other than the default salesforce logout page .
the url must be fully qualified with an http  or https  prefix , such as https://acme.my.salesforce.com .
d. select an already existing apex class as the registration handler  class or click automatically create a registration handler template  to create an apex class template for the registration handler .
you must edit this class and modify the default content before using it .
note :  you must specify a registration handler class for salesforce to generate the single sign - on initialization url .
e. select the user that runs the apex handler class for execute registration as .
the user must have “ manage users ” permission .
a user is required if you selected a registration handler class or are automatically creating one .
to use a portal with your provider , select the portal from the portal drop - down list .
f. g. use the icon url  field to add a path to an icon to display as a button on the login page for a community .
this icon applies to a community only , and does not appear on the login page for your salesforce organization or custom domain created with my domain .
users click the button to log in with the associated authentication provider for the community .
you can specify a path to your own image , or copy the url for one of our sample icons into the field .
note :  if you want to change the google default endpoints , you can create an openid connect authorization provider and populate those fields .
for more information , see configure an openid connect authentication provider . 9 .

be sure to note the generated auth .
provider i d  value .
you must use it with the auth .
authtoken apex class .
several client configuration urls are generated after defining the authentication provider : •
test - only initialization url : administrators use this url to ensure the third - party provider is set up correctly .
the administrator opens this url in a browser , signs in to the third party , and is redirected back to salesforce with a map of attributes . •
single sign - on initialization url : use this url to perform single sign - on into salesforce from a third party ( using third - party credentials ) .
the end user opens this url in a browser , and signs in to the third party .
this then either creates a new user for them , or updates an existing user , and then signs them into salesforce as that user . •
existing user linking url : use this url to link existing salesforce users to a third - party account .
the end user opens this url in a browser , signs in to the third party , signs in to salesforce , and approves the link . •
oauth - only initialization url : use this url to obtain oauth access tokens for a third party .
users must authenticate with salesforce for the third - party service to get a token ; this flow does not provide for future single sign - on functionality .
241 salesforce spring ’15 release notes security and identity • callback url : use the callback url for the endpoint that the authentication provider calls back to for configuration .
the authentication provider has to redirect to the callback url  with information for each of the above client configuration urls .
the client configuration urls support additional request parameters that enable you to direct users to log into specific sites , obtain customized permissions from the third party , or go to a specific location after authenticating .
update your google application after defining the google authentication provider in your salesforce organization , go back to google and update your application to use the callback url  as the google website site url .
test the single sign - on connection in a browser , open the test - only initialization url  on the auth .

you can simplify the setup of authenticated apex callouts by specifying a named credential as the callout endpoint .
doing so enables salesforce to securely handle all the authentication , so that you do n’t have to do so in your code .
you can also skip remote site settings , which are otherwise required for apex callouts to external sites .
available in all editions editions you can instead specify a url as the callout endpoint and register that url in your organization ’s remote site settings .
in that case , however , you handle the authentication in your code .
doing so can be less secure and especially complicated for oauth authentication .
by separating the endpoint url and authentication from the apex code , named credentials make callouts easier to maintain .
for example , if an endpoint url changes , you simply update the named credential .
all callouts that reference the named credential then continue to work without any changes to the code .
if you have multiple organizations , you can create a named credential with the same name in each organization .
each of these named credentials can have a different endpoint url , for example , to accommodate differences in development and production environments .
because the code references only the name of the named credential , the same apex class can be packaged and deployed in all your organizations without the code having to programmatically check the environment .
named credentials support basic password authentication and oauth 2.0 .
you can set up each named credential to use an organization - wide named principal or to use per - user authentication so that users can manage their own credentials .
for an example , see simplify authenticated apex callouts by specifying named credentials as endpoints on page 273 .
for setup information , see “ define a named credential ” in the salesforce help .
track login history by id with session context the login history id is now associated with the sessions per login event .

this capability helps you discriminate between valid and invalid login requests and track user login patterns for future reference .
when a user logs in to a salesforce account , the activity generates a login_event  event log file .
similarly , the end of a user session generates a logout_event  event log file .
a session ends either when it expires due to user inactivity or when the user logs out of salesforce .

login forensics helps administrators better determine which user behavior is legitimate .
it provides you key user access data , including : • the average number of logins per user per a specified time period . •
who logged in more than the average number of times . •
who logged in during non - business hours . •

sign saml single sign - on requests with rsa - sha256 you can sign outbound saml request assertions to an identity provider for single sign - on using the rsa - sha256 algorithm .
this enhancement provides stronger security than rsa - sha1 and interoperability with identity providers such as active directory federation services ( adfs ) .
an identity provider is a trusted provider that enables you to use single sign - on to access other websites .
when you configure a new identity provider , you provide values for communicating with the identity provider using saml assertions .
these assertions can be signed using the rsa - sha256 algorithm to help secure the information sent to the identity provider .
configure saml for single sign - on in security controls > single sign - on settings .
as part of this enhancement , the signing certificate field is now the request signing certificate  field .
after you select the certificate , set the signing algorithm in the request signature method field .

provide code challenge and verifier values for oauth 2.0 web server flow
for nonce - based oauth 2.0 web server flows , you can specify an arbitrary code challenge value and a corresponding code verifier to help prevent authorization code interception attacks .
this feature is only supported in the oauth 2.0 web server authentication flow .
in the web server flow , the client can pass additional code_challenge and code_verifier values as parameters to the authorization endpoint and token endpoint , respectively .
the code_verifier  is a base64url - encoded arbitrary value .
the code_challenge  is a base64url - encoded sha256 hash of the code_verifier .
during the flow execution , if the client passes a code_challenge  to the authorization endpoint , salesforce validates the code_verifier  from the token endpoint and compares it to the code_challenge  from the authorization endpoint .

for information on enabling this feature for your organization , contact salesforce .
connected apps link your users with third - party services and applications .
user provisioning for connected apps lets you create , update , and manage user accounts for those services and applications .
this simplifies account creation for services such as google apps , and links your salesforce users’ accounts to their third - party accounts .
user provisioning applies only to users assigned to a profile or permission set granting them access to the configured connected app .
for example , you can configure user provisioning for a google apps connected app in your organization .
then assign the profile “ employees ” to that connected app .
when a new user is created in your organization and assigned the “ employees ” profile , the user is automatically provisioned in google apps .
additionally , when the user is deactivated , or the profile assignment changes , the user is automatically de - provisioned from google apps .

however , if the group itself is deleted and has no members , any remaining shares to those groups grant no access .
this new feature allows these obsolete shares to be removed asynchronously , and administrators no longer have to wait for those shares to be deleted before continuing with other operations .
when deleting groups , obsolete shares to those groups are deleted during off - peak hours to minimize your waiting time during those operations .
these groups include : • public groups • territories • roles • queues
members of these groups lose access to records that are shared to them immediately because the groups no longer exist .
users who are higher than these members in the role hierarchy also lose access to those records .
deactivated users lose access to shared records immediately .

this section : deploy your components in less time ( generally available ) you can now deploy components to production by skipping the execution of all apex tests for components that have been validated within the last four days .
with quick deploy , you no longer have to wait for all tests to run for your deployment to complete in production , and your deployment will likely finish in less than 30 minutes .
deploy and retrieve more components the number of files that you can deploy or retrieve has doubled .
with this limit increase , you can migrate components from a large organization with more than 5,000 files without having to split deployments into smaller sets of components .
delete components before and after component updates you can control when components are deleted in a deployment .
use a manifest to specify component deletions before updates , and use another manifest to specify component deletions after updates . specifying the processing order of deletions relative to component updates
provides you with greater flexibility and enables you to delete components with dependencies .
change sandbox type when refreshing when you refresh a sandbox , you have the option to change to a different type of sandbox environment , depending on your available sandbox licenses .
deploy your components in less time ( generally available ) you can now deploy components to production by skipping the execution of all apex tests for components that have been validated within the last four days .
with quick deploy , you no longer have to wait for all tests to run for your deployment to complete in production , and your deployment will likely finish in less than 30 minutes .
as part of a deployment , all apex tests are run in production .
if the production organization contains many apex tests , the execution of all tests can be time - consuming and can delay your deployment .
to reduce deployment time to production , you can perform a quick deployment by skipping the execution of all tests .
quick deployments are available for change sets and metadata api components when the following requirements are met . •
the components have been validated successfully for the target environment within the last four days ( 96 hours ) . •
as part of the validation , all apex tests in the target organization have passed . •
the overall code coverage in the organization is at least 75% , and apex triggers have some coverage .
a validation is a deployment that ’s used only to check the results of deploying components and does n’t save any components in the organization .
a validation enables you to view the success or failure messages that you would receive with an actual deployment .
you can validate change sets or metadata components through the api or the force.com migration tool .
to learn how to validate a change set , see validating a change set in the salesforce help .
to validate components with the force.com migration tool , set the checkonly  option to true  in the deploy target .
see deploying changes to a salesforce organization in the force.com migration tool guide .
259 salesforce spring ’15 release notes change sets and deployment performing a quick deployment through the user interface or the api to perform a quick deployment , first run a validation - only deployment with apex test execution on the set of components that you need to deploy .
if your validation succeeds and qualifies for a quick deployment , you can start a quick deployment .
you can quick - deploy validated change sets and metadata api components in the user interface .
in the deployment status page , deploy a recent validation by clicking quick deploy next to your validation or on the validation ’s detail page .
this button appears only for qualifying validations .
alternatively , you can start a quick deployment through the metadata api by calling deployrecentvalidation ( )  and passing it the validation id .
use this api call to deploy metadata api components .
this call does n’t apply to change sets .
note :  quick deploy is enabled for recent validations in which all apex tests have executed successfully and code coverage requirements have been met .
note the following . •
because apex tests are required to run in production , quick deployments are supported in production for validations that meet the criteria .
you can deploy recent validations of change sets and metadata api components ( including components validated by using the force.com migration tool ) . •
when deploying to non - production environments ( sandbox ) , apex tests are n’t required and are n’t run automatically .
when you ’re using metadata api ( including the force.com migration tool ) , quick deploy is supported in sandbox only for validations that explicitly enable the execution of tests ( for example , via the runalltests  parameter for the migration tool ) .
for change sets , quick deploy is not supported in sandbox because there is no option to enable test runs for change sets in sandbox . •
if you perform a deployment after a validation , whether through quick deploy or a regular deployment , all validations no longer qualify for quick deployment .
revalidate the set of components that you need to quick - deploy .
deploy and retrieve more components the number of files that you can deploy or retrieve has doubled .
with this limit increase , you can migrate components from a large organization with more than 5,000 files without having to split deployments into smaller sets of components .
this table compares the old and new file limit for metadata components . 260 salesforce spring ’15 release notes change sets and deployment table 3 : increased file limit for metadata components description maximum number of files that can be deployed or retrieved at a time old limit 5,000 files
new limit 10,000 files this file limit applies to metadata api and also to the number of files that are included as part of a change set .
this limit increase does n’t affect the total size of all files that are deployed or retrieved , which remains at 400 mb .
delete components before and after component updates you can control when components are deleted in a deployment .
use a manifest to specify component deletions before updates , and use another manifest to specify component deletions after updates .
specifying the processing order of deletions relative to component updates provides you with greater flexibility and enables you to delete components with dependencies .
to delete components , use the same procedure as with deploying components , but also include the appropriate delete manifest files .
the format of the delete manifest is the same as package.xml  except that wildcards are n’t supported . •
to delete components before adding or updating other components , create a manifest file that ’s named destructivechangespre.xml  and include the components to delete . •
to delete components after adding or updating other components , create a manifest file that ’s named destructivechangespost.xml  and include the components to delete .
this feature applies to the metadata api deploy ( )  call or metadata api - based tools , such as the force.com migration tool .
the ability to specify when deletions are processed is useful when you ’re deleting components with dependencies .
for example , if a custom object is referenced in an apex class , you ca n’t delete it unless you modify the apex class first to remove the dependency on the custom object .
in this example , you can perform a single deployment that updates the apex class to clear the dependency and then deletes the custom object by using destructivechangespost.xml .
the following are samples of the package.xml  and destructivechangespost.xml  manifests that would be used in this example .
sample package.xml , which specifies the class to update : < ?
xml version="1.0 " encoding="utf-8 " ?
> < package xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata " > < types > < members > sampleclass</members > < name > apexclass</name >
< /types > < version>33.0</version > < /package >
sample destructivechangespost.xml , which specifies the custom object to delete after the class update : < ?
xml version="1.0 " encoding="utf-8 " ?
> < package xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata " > < types > < /types > < /package > < members > mycustomobject__c</members > <
name > customobject</name > note : • the api version that the deployment uses is the api version that ’s specified in package.xml .
261 salesforce spring ’15 release notes visualforce •
the destructivechangespre.xml  and destructivechangespost.xml  manifests are supported starting with api version 33.0 .
in earlier versions , only destructivechanges.xml  is supported .
in api version 33.0 and later , if the processing order for deletions and additions does n’t matter , you can continue using destructivechanges.xml . •
when you ’re using destructivechanges.xml , deletions are processed first by default .
change sandbox type when refreshing when you refresh a sandbox , you have the option to change to a different type of sandbox environment , depending on your available sandbox licenses .
when you select one of your existing sandboxes to refresh , a list of your available licenses for each type of sandbox ( developer , developer pro , partial copy , full ) appears .
you can choose to change the type of sandbox environment during the refresh if you have an available license for that sandbox type .
visualforce develop apps that combine visualforce and javascript , including salesforce1 and other mobile apps .
visualforce language and feature improvements make app development easier .
enhancements in this release are focused on improving the experience of developing apps that combine visualforce , javascript , and location - based data .
these release notes explain new features in this release , and include concise code samples showing how these features can be used .
for complete details on features affected by these enhancements , refer to the visualforce developer ’s guide .

editions available in : contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions use visualforce map components to show location data more clearly visualforce mapping components make it simple to create maps that use third - party mapping services .
visualforce maps are interactive , javascript - based maps complete with zooming , scrolling , and markers based on your salesforce or other data .
create stand - alone map pages , maps that you can insert into page layouts , and even mobile maps for salesforce1 .
new attributes for < flow : interview > available in api version 33.0 and later , the < flow : interview >  components supports a new attribute : allowshowpause .
use this attribute to customize your users’ experience when pausing flows .
change in parameter values for sforce.one.navigatetorelatedlist ( )
the sforce.one  javascript utility object is used to manage navigation for salesforce1 apps written in visualforce .
the accepted values for the relatedlistid  parameter of the navigatetorelatedlist ( )  function have changed to always use the api names of related lists .
change in attribute defaults for < apex : page >
when in salesforce1 visualforce pages automatically suppress the display of the standard salesforce header and sidebar when they ’re displayed in salesforce1 .
beginning in api version 33.0 , the associated style sheets and javascript are also suppressed by default .
this should improve page performance .
urls returned by the urlfor function optimized for attachments the urlfor function has been optimized for use with attachments in visualforce . 262 salesforce spring ’15 release notes visualforce change in activation date for “ serve static resources from the visualforce domain ” critical update salesforce issued a critical update in the winter ’15 release , available in the critical update console ( cruc ) , titled “
serve static resources from the visualforce domain .
” this critical update originally had an auto - activation date of 12/11/2014 .
in order to give customers and partners more time to validate and resolve issues that have arisen from this change , this critical update has been postponed until the summer ’15 release , and the update is no longer visible in the critical update console .
use visualforce map components to show location data
more clearly visualforce mapping components make it simple to create maps that use third - party mapping services .
visualforce maps are interactive , javascript - based maps complete with zooming , scrolling , and markers based on your salesforce or other data .
create stand - alone map pages , maps that you can insert into page layouts , and even mobile maps for salesforce1 .
create visualforce maps with a set of related mapping components .
< apex : map >  defines a map canvas , including map size , type , center point , and initial zoom level .
< apex : mapmarker >  child components define markers to place on the map , by address or geolocation ( latitude and longitude ) .
maps that you define generate javascript code to render onto the page .
this javascript connects to a mapping service and builds the map by fetching map tiles , placing markers , and even geocoding addresses if you do n’t have a latitude and longitude .
after the map renders , your users can interact with the map by panning and zooming , just like they ’re used to with other popular map sites .
the effect is if you wrote your own custom javascript to interact with a third - party mapping service , but without needing to actually write that javascript .
you define the map in visualforce and get the mapping javascript for free .
note :  visualforce mapping components are n’t currently available in developer edition organizations .
example of using visualforce map components here ’s a page that shows a list of contacts for an account , centered on the account ’s address .
< apex : page standardcontroller="account " > < ! -- this page must be accessed with an account i d in the url .
for example : https://<salesforceinstance>/apex / nearbycontacts?id=001d000000jrbet -- > < apex : pageblock > < apex : pageblocksection title="contacts for { ! account .
name } " > < apex : datalist value= " { !
account .
contacts } " var="contact " > < apex : outputtext value= " { ! contact .
name } " / >
< /apex : datalist > < apex : map width="600px " height="400px " maptype="roadmap " center="{!account .
billingstreet},{!account .
billingcity},{!account .
billingstate } " > < apex : repeat value= " { !
account .
contacts } " var="contact " > < apex : mapmarker title= " { ! contact .
name }
" position="{!contact .
mailingstreet},{!contact .
mailingcity},{!contact .
mailingstate } " / > < /apex : repeat > < /apex : map > < /apex : pageblocksection > 263 salesforce spring ’15 release notes visualforce < /apex : pageblock > < /apex : page > the preceding code produces the following map .
for details of how to use the new mapping components , including additional code samples , see “ creating maps with visualforce ” in the visualforce developer ’s guide .
new attributes for < flow : interview > available in api version 33.0 and later , the < flow : interview >  components supports a new attribute : allowshowpause .
use this attribute to customize your users’ experience when pausing flows .
allowshowpause after you embed a flow in a visualforce page , consider whether you want to let users pause flows from that page .
this is a good way to allow some users to pause a certain flow , but not others .
set the allowshowpause attribute for < flow : interview >  to false to prevent users from pausing .
change in parameter values for sforce.one.navigatetorelatedlist ( )
the sforce.one  javascript utility object is used to manage navigation for salesforce1 apps written in visualforce .
the accepted values for the relatedlistid  parameter of the navigatetorelatedlist ( )  function have changed to always use the api names of related lists .
previously , some standard lists used an internal id instead of the api name .
these internal ids were n’t documented , were hard to discover , and could n’t be retrieved dynamically .
in spring ’15 they are no longer supported .
if you ’ve used sforce.one.navigatetorelatedlist ( )  to navigate to related lists in your salesforce1 apps , you might need to update any hard - coded parameter values .
264 salesforce spring ’15 release notes visualforce change in attribute defaults for < apex : page >
when in salesforce1 visualforce pages automatically suppress the display of the standard salesforce header and sidebar when they ’re displayed in salesforce1 .
beginning in api version 33.0 , the associated style sheets and javascript are also suppressed by default .
this should improve page performance .
in standard visualforce the showheader , sidebar , and standardstylesheet  attributes of < apex : page >  default to true , which means that the standard salesforce header and sidebar are displayed , and salesforce styles are used for the page .
when the same page is displayed within salesforce1 , the header and sidebar are removed automatically , in favor of the mobile - optimized user interface of salesforce1 .
however , in prior releases this behavior only removed the html for the header and sidebar .
with this change , the showheader , sidebar , and standardstylesheet  attributes default to false  when the page is rendered in the salesforce1 app container ( either the salesforce1 mobile app , or one.app in a standard browser ) .
the effect of the change is to suppress the inclusion of salesforce style sheets and javascript that are used for the header and sidebar when the page is rendered in salesforce1 .
the overall result is to reduce the size of the resources that are sent to the page , which sometimes improves performance , especially for slow network connections .
this change is versioned .
set your page to api version 33.0 or later to invoke the new behavior .
note :  if a page includes standard visualforce user interface components that require styles or javascript — for example , < apex : inputfield>—visualforce sometimes includes standard resources that are otherwise suppressed .
this inclusion of resources is required to maintain component functionality .
urls returned by the urlfor function optimized for attachments the urlfor function has been optimized for use with attachments in visualforce .
previously , when used with attachments , the urlfor function returned a url that responded with a redirect , which provided the “ real ” url for the attachment download .
if a page includes many of these expressions on a page , the additional network requests sometimes caused the page to load more slowly than expected .
with this change , urlfor returns the direct url for the attachment , which improves page performance .
this change only affects urlfor responses when they ’re used with attachments , as in the following sample code .
< apex : page standardcontroller="attachment " > value="{!urlfor($action . attachment .
download , attachment.id ) } " > download now ! < apex : outputlink <
/apex : outputlink > < apex : image value="{!urlfor($action . attachment .
download , attachment.id)}"/ >
< /apex : page > change in activation date for “ serve static resources from the visualforce domain ”
critical update salesforce issued a critical update in the winter ’15 release , available in the critical update console ( cruc ) , titled “
serve static resources from the visualforce domain .
” this critical update originally had an auto - activation date of 12/11/2014 .
in order to give customers and partners more time to validate and resolve issues that have arisen from this change , this critical update has been postponed until the summer ’15 release , and the update is no longer visible in the critical update console .
a new activation date will be published when this critical update is re - enabled .
265 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code apex code using syntax that looks like java and acts like database stored procedures , apex enables developers to add business logic to most system events , including button clicks , related record updates , and visualforce pages .
apex code execution can be initiated by web service requests and from triggers on objects .
apex includes the following enhancements .
for detailed information on these enhancements , refer to the force.com apex code developer 's guide .
editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , developer , and database.com editions in
this section : submit more batch jobs with apex flex queue ( generally available ) submit up to 100 batch jobs simultaneously and actively manage the order of the queued jobs to control which batch jobs are processed first .
this enhancement provides you more flexibility in managing your batch jobs .
make long - running callouts from a visualforce page use asynchronous callouts to make long - running requests from a visualforce page to an external web service and process responses in callback methods .
asynchronous callouts that are made from a visualforce page do n’t count toward the apex limit of 10 synchronous requests that last longer than five seconds .
as a result , you can make more long - running callouts and you can integrate your visualforce pages with complex back - end assets .
set up test data for an entire test class use test setup methods ( methods that are annotated with @testsetup ) to create test records once and then access them in every test method in the test class .
test setup methods can be time - saving when you need to create reference or prerequisite data for all test methods , or a common set of records that all test methods operate on .
chain more jobs with queueable apex queueable apex was introduced in winter ’15 and enables you to easily start and manage asynchronous processes .
previously , you could chain a queueable job to another job only once .
you can now chain a job to another job an unlimited number of times .
for developer edition and trial organizations , your chain can have up to five queueable jobs .
access address and geolocation compound fields using apex you can now access address and geolocation compound fields in apex using the new address  and location classes .
you could previously access only compound fields’ component fields in apex .
you can now query compound fields and their components using the new address  and location  class methods .
make apex callouts with more data the callout size limit for requests and responses has been increased to the heap size limit .
with a larger callout size for requests and responses , you can send and receive more data from an external web service .
list apex classes and triggers with a tooling api endpoint use the apexmanifest tooling api endpoint to list all of your apex classes and triggers , including global classes and triggers from your installed managed packages .
rather than querying both the apexclass and apextrigger objects , you can retrieve a quick list of both classes and triggers with just one api call .
unlike apexclass , apexmanifest  retrieves your inner classes — previously , you needed to get and parse the symbol table to retrieve your inner classes .
simplify authenticated apex callouts by specifying named credentials as endpoints a named credential specifies the url of a callout endpoint and its required authentication parameters in one definition .
salesforce manages all the authentication for apex callouts that specify a named credential as the callout endpoint , so that your code does n’t have to . 266 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code check data isolation mode for executed tests in the apex soap api the runtestsuccess and runtestfailure apex api objects now contain the seealldata  boolean field .
this field indicates whether the test method has access to organization data and helps you troubleshoot test failures .
string methods fixed for escaping additional characters when you activate this update , these apex string methods will escape additional characters : escapehtml3 , escapehtml4 , and escapeecmascript .
code coverage bug fixes code coverage numbers in your organization can change because of enhancements we made to fix bugs in code coverage .
if your organization hasn’t changed , and you haven’t added new apex code , these enhancements can cause different code coverage results than prior to spring ’15 .
predictable iteration order for unordered collections this update causes the iteration order of unordered collections ( map  and set ) to be deterministic .
when you activate this critical update , the order of elements in maps and sets is the same every time your code is run again .
this update can cause a different iteration order for maps and sets than the current order .
new and changed apex classes these classes , methods , annotations , and interfaces are new or have changed in this release .
submit more batch jobs with apex flex queue ( generally available ) submit up to 100 batch jobs simultaneously and actively manage the order of the queued jobs to control which batch jobs are processed first .
this enhancement provides you more flexibility in managing your batch jobs .
note :  for all new organizations in spring ’15 , apex flex queue is enabled by default .
to enable apex flex queue in an existing organization , activate the apex flex queue critical update in setup .
this update does n’t change the way you submit batch jobs but enables you to submit more batch jobs than before .
this update does n’t affect the existing behavior of processing batch jobs after they ’re queued .
the holding  status has been added for batch jobs , which might affect queries against asyncapexjob .
see “ critical updates overview ” in the salesforce help for more details about critical updates .
previously , you could submit only up to five batch jobs simultaneously .
the apex flex queue enables you to submit up to 100 additional batch jobs for execution .
any jobs that are submitted for execution are in holding status and are placed in the apex flex queue .
up to 100 batch jobs can be in the holding status .
when system resources become available , the system picks up jobs from the top of the apex flex queue and moves them to the batch job queue .
the system can process up to five queued or active jobs simultaneously .
the status of these moved jobs changes from holding  to queued .
queued jobs get executed when the system is ready to process new jobs .
administrators can modify the order of jobs that are held in the apex flex queue to control when they get processed by the system .
for example , administrators can move a batch job up to the first position in the holding queue so that it ’s the first job that gets processed when the system fetches the next held job from the flex queue .
without administrator intervention , jobs are processed first - in first - out — in the order in which they ’re submitted .
to monitor and reorder held batch jobs in the salesforce user interface , from setup click jobs > apex flex queue . submitting jobs by calling database.executebatch when you submit batch jobs by calling database.executebatch , the system places your batch job in holding  status before processing the job .
the outcome of database.executebatch  is as follows .
267 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code •
the batch job is placed in the apex flex queue , and its status is set to holding . •
if the apex flex queue has the maximum number of 100 jobs , database.executebatch  throws a limitexception and does n’t add the job to the queue .
when system resources become available , the system picks up the next job from the top of the flex queue for processing and changes its status to queued .
new asyncapexjob status field value the asyncapexjob object , which represents a batch job , has a new status  field value of holding .
this new status indicates that the job is placed in the flex queue and is waiting to be processed when system resources become available .
make long - running callouts from a visualforce page use asynchronous callouts to make long - running requests from a visualforce page to an external web service and process responses in callback methods .
asynchronous callouts that are made from a visualforce page do n’t count toward the apex limit of 10 synchronous requests that last longer than five seconds .
as a result , you can make more long - running callouts and you can integrate your visualforce pages with complex back - end assets .
an asynchronous callout is a callout that is made from a visualforce page for which the response is returned through a callback method .
an asynchronous callout is also referred to as a continuation .
this diagram shows the execution path of an asynchronous callout , starting from a visualforce page .
a user invokes an action on a visualforce page that requests information from a web service ( step 1 ) .
the app server hands the callout request to the continuation server before returning to the visualforce page ( steps 2–3 ) .
the continuation server sends the request to the web service and receives the response ( steps 4–7 ) , then hands the response back to the app server ( step 8) .
finally , the response is returned to the visualforce page ( step 9 ) .
execution flow of an asynchronous callout a typical salesforce application that benefits from asynchronous callouts is one that contains a visualforce page with a button that users click to get data from an external web service .
for example , the visualforce page might get warranty information for a certain product from a web service .
this page can be used by thousands of agents in the organization .
consequently , a hundred of those agents might click the same button to process warranty information for products at the same time .
these hundred simultaneous actions exceed the limit of concurrent long - running requests of 10 , but by using asynchronous callouts , the requests are n’t subjected to this limit and can be executed .
268 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code in the following example application , the button action is implemented in an apex controller method .
the action method creates a continuation  and returns it .
after the the request is sent to the service , the visualforce request is suspended .
the user must wait for the response to be returned before proceeding with using the page and invoking new actions .
when the external service returns a response , the visualforce request resumes and the page receives this response .
this is the visualforce page of our sample application .
this page contains a button that invokes the startrequest  method of the controller that ’s associated with this page .
after the continuation result is returned and the callback method is invoked , the button renders the outputtext  component again to display the body of the response .
< apex : page controller="continuationcontroller " showchat="false " showheader="false " > < ! -- invokes the action method when the user clicks this button .
-- > < apex : commandbutton action="{!startrequest } " value="start request " rerender="result"/ > < apex : form > < /apex : form > < ! -- this output text component displays the callout response body . --
> < apex : outputtext id="result " value="{!result } " / >
< /apex : page > the following is the apex controller that ’s associated with the visualforce page .
this controller contains the action and callback methods .
note :  before you can call an external service , you must add the remote site to a list of authorized remote sites in the salesforce user interface .
from setup , click security controls > remote site settings , and then click new remote site .
public with sharing class continuationcontroller { //
unique label corresponding to the continuation public string requestlabel ; // result of callout public string result { get;set ; } // endpoint of long - running service private static final string long_running_service_url = ' < insert your service url > ' ; // action method public object startrequest ( ) { //
create continuation with a timeout continuation con = new continuation(40 ) ; //
set callback method con.continuationmethod='processresponse ' ; //
create callout request httprequest req = new httprequest ( ) ; req.setmethod('get ' ) ; req.setendpoint(long_running_service_url ) ; //
add callout request to continuation this.requestlabel = con.addhttprequest(req ) ; //
return the continuation return con ; } //
callback method public object processresponse ( ) { 269 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code //
get the response by using the unique label httpresponse response = continuation.getresponse(this.requestlabel ) ; //
set the result variable that is displayed on the visualforce page this.result = response.getbody ( ) ; //
return null to re - render the original visualforce page return null ; } } note : • you can make up to three asynchronous callouts in a single continuation .
add these callout requests to the same continuation by using the addhttprequest  method of the continuation  class .
the callouts run in parallel for this continuation and suspend the visualforce request .
only after all callouts are returned by the external service for does the visualforce process resume . •
asynchronous callouts are supported only through a visualforce page .
making an asynchronous callout by invoking the action method outside a visualforce page , such as in the developer console , is n’t supported . •
asynchronous callouts are available for apex controllers and visualforce pages saved in version 30.0 and later .
if javascript remoting is used , version 31.0 or later is required .
set up test data for an entire test class use test setup methods ( methods that are annotated with @testsetup ) to create test records once and then access them in every test method in the test class .
test setup methods can be time - saving when you need to create reference or prerequisite data for all test methods , or a common set of records that all test methods operate on .
test setup methods can reduce test execution times especially when you ’re working with many records .
test setup methods enable you to create common test data easily and efficiently .
by setting up records once for the class , you do n’t need to re - create records for each test method .
also , because the rollback of records that are created during test setup happens at the end of the execution of the entire class , the number of records that are rolled back is reduced .
as a result , system resources are used more efficiently compared to creating those records and having them rolled back for each test method .
if a test class contains a test setup method , the testing framework executes the test setup method first , before any test method in the class .
records that are created in a test setup method are available to all test methods in the test class and are rolled back at the end of test class execution .
if a test method changes those records , such as record field updates or record deletions , those changes are rolled back after each test method finishes execution .
the next executing test method gets access to the original unmodified state of those records .
syntax test setup methods are defined in a test class , take no arguments , and return no value .
the following is the syntax of a test setup method .
@testsetup static void methodname ( ) { } 270 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code example the following example shows how to create test records once and then access them in multiple test methods .
also , the example shows how changes that are made in the first test method are rolled back and are not available to the second test method . @istest private class commontestsetup { @testsetup static void setup ( ) { //
create common test accounts list < account > testaccts = new list < account > ( ) ; for(integer i=0;i<2;i++ ) { testaccts.add(new account(name = ' testacct'+i ) ) ; } insert testaccts ; } @istest static void testmethod1 ( ) { //
get the first test account by using a soql query account acct = [ select i d from account where name='testacct0 ' limit 1 ] ; //
modify first account acct .
phone = ' 555 - 1212 ' ; //
this update is local to this test method only .
update acct ; //
delete second account account acct2 = [ select i d from account where name='testacct1 ' limit 1 ] ; //
this deletion is local to this test method only .
delete acct2 ; // perform some testing } @istest static void testmethod2 ( ) { //
the changes made by testmethod1 ( ) are rolled back and // are not visible to this test method . //
get the first account by using a soql query account acct = [ select phone from account where name='testacct0 ' limit 1 ] ; // verify that test account created by test setup method is unaltered .
system.assertequals(null , acct .
phone ) ; //
get the second account by using a soql query account acct2 = [ select i d from account where name='testacct1 ' limit 1 ] ; //
verify test account created by test setup method is unaltered .
system.assertnotequals(null , acct2 ) ; // perform some testing } } 271 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code
test setup method considerations •
test setup methods are supported only with the default data isolation mode for a test class .
if the test class or a test method has access to organization data by using the @istest(seealldata = true )  annotation , test setup methods are n’t supported in this class .
because data isolation for tests is available for api versions 24.0 and later , test setup methods are also available for those versions only . •
multiple test setup methods are allowed in a test class , but the order in which they ’re executed by the testing framework is n’t guaranteed . •
if a fatal error occurs during the execution of a test setup method , such as an exception that ’s caused by a dml operation or an assertion failure , the entire test class fails , and no further tests in the class are executed . •
if a test setup method calls a non - test method of another class , no code coverage is calculated for the non - test method .
chain more jobs with queueable apex queueable apex was introduced in winter ’15 and enables you to easily start and manage asynchronous processes .
previously , you could chain a queueable job to another job only once .
you can now chain a job to another job an unlimited number of times .
for developer edition and trial organizations , your chain can have up to five queueable jobs .
chaining jobs is useful when you need to run a job after some other processing is done .
to chain a job to another job , submit the second job from the execute ( )  method of your queueable class .
for example , if you have a second class that ’s called secondjob  that implements the queueable  interface , you can add this class to the queue in the execute ( )  method as follows : public class asyncexecutionexample implements queueable { public void execute(queueablecontext context ) { //
your processing logic here //
chain this job to next job by submitting the next job system.enqueuejob(new secondjob ( ) ) ; } } only one job can be started by a queueable job in the chain .
access address and geolocation compound fields using apex you can now access address and geolocation compound fields in apex using the new address  and location classes .
you could previously access only compound fields’ component fields in apex .
you can now query compound fields and their components using the new address  and location  class methods . declare a variable of type address  or location  first , then access the subfields on that variable .
for example , you can retrieve the city , zip code , and state values on an address field .
account acct = [ select billingaddress from account where name='acme ' limit 1 ] ; address addr = acct .
billingaddress ; string acctcity = addr.city ; string acctzipcode = addr.postalcode ; string acctstate = addr.state ; or , you can retrieve the latitude and longitude values of a geolocation field .
account acct2 = [ select i d , mylocation__c from account where name='cloud computing ' limit 1 ] ; location loc = acct2.mylocation__c ; 272 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code double lat = loc.latitude ; double lon = loc.longitude ; make apex callouts with more data the callout size limit for requests and responses has been increased to the heap size limit .
with a larger callout size for requests and responses , you can send and receive more data from an external web service .
this table compares the old and new limits for callout request and response sizes .
table 4 : increased callout size limits description old limit new limit maximum size of callout request or response ( http request or web services call ) 3 mb 6 mb for synchronous apex or 12 mb for asynchronous apex list apex classes and triggers with a tooling api endpoint use the apexmanifest tooling api endpoint to list all of your apex classes and triggers , including global classes and triggers from your installed managed packages .
rather than querying both the apexclass and apextrigger objects , you can retrieve a quick list of both classes and triggers with just one api call .
unlike apexclass , apexmanifest  retrieves your inner classes — previously , you needed to get and parse the symbol table to retrieve your inner classes .
example :
to retrieve your apex classes and triggers , and the global apex classes and triggers from your installed managed packages : req.setendpoint('http://na1.salesforce.com/services/data/v33.0/tooling/apexmanifest ' ) ; req.setmethod('get ' ) ; simplify authenticated apex callouts by specifying named credentials as endpoints a named credential specifies the url of a callout endpoint and its required authentication parameters in one definition .
salesforce manages all the authentication for apex callouts that specify a named credential as the callout endpoint , so that your code does n’t have to .
you can instead specify a url as the callout endpoint and register that url in your organization ’s remote site settings .
in that case , however , you handle the authentication in your code .
doing so can be less secure and especially complicated for oauth authentication .
for more information , see “ define a named credential ” in the salesforce help .
example :
in the following sample code , a named credential and an appended path specify the callout ’s endpoint . httprequest req = new httprequest ( ) ; req.setendpoint('callout:my_named_credential/some_path ' ) ; req.setmethod('get ' ) ; http http = new http ( ) ; httpresponse res = http.send(req ) ; system.debug(res.getbody ( ) ) ; the referenced named credential specifies the endpoint url and the authentication settings . 273 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code you can code the callout endpoint as the url instead of the named credential , but your code then handles the authentication .
our example uses basic password authentication , but keep in mind that oauth authentication is much more complex and best handled with named credentials .
httprequest req = new httprequest ( ) ; req.setendpoint('https://my_endpoint.example.com/some_path ' ) ; req.setmethod('get ' ) ; // specify the required user name and password to access the endpoint //
as well as the header and header information string username = ' myname ' ; string password = ' mypwd ' ; blob headervalue = blob.valueof(username + ' : ' + password ) ; string authorizationheader = ' basic ' + encodingutil.base64encode(headervalue ) ; req.setheader('authorization ' , authorizationheader ) ; //
create a new http object to send the request object //
a response object is generated as a result of the request http http = new http ( ) ; httpresponse res = http.send(req ) ; system.debug(res.getbody ( ) ) ; check data isolation mode for executed tests in the apex soap api the runtestsuccess and runtestfailure apex api objects now contain the seealldata  boolean field .
this field indicates whether the test method has access to organization data and helps you troubleshoot test failures .
if you run apex tests through the apex soap api by calling runtests ( )  or compileandtest ( ) , runtestsresult contains the results of all tests .
for each success or failure of a test method , runtestsresult contains a corresponding runtestsuccess or runtestfailure object respectively .
you can inspect the seealldata  boolean field on these objects to determine whether the test method had access to organization data during the test run .
274 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code string methods fixed for escaping additional characters when you activate this update , these apex string methods will escape additional characters : escapehtml3 , escapehtml4 , and escapeecmascript .
currently , these string methods do n’t escape certain characters .
when you activate this update , these methods will escape the following additional characters . •
escapehtml3 : '  ( single quote ) • escapehtml4 : '  ( single quote ) • escapeecmascript : <  ( opening angle bracket ) and > ( closing angle bracket ) this update changes the behavior of the affected string class methods for all api versions .
code coverage bug fixes code coverage numbers in your organization can change because of enhancements we made to fix bugs in code coverage .
if your organization hasn’t changed , and you haven’t added new apex code , these enhancements can cause different code coverage results than prior to spring ’15 .
one possible reason for a miscalculation was caused when a row was manually deleted from the apexcodecoverageaggregate tooling api object .
the deleted row was n’t recreated when rerunning tests , resulting in incorrect code coverage numbers .
the row is now recreated in apexcodecoverageaggregate when tests are run again .
also , some other code coverage calculation bugs were fixed .
because of these issues , the overall code coverage sometimes differed from the coverage reported during a deployment or package install .
to ensure that you have the latest code coverage percentage in your organization , refresh your code coverage by rerunning tests .
to learn more about troubleshooting code coverage in your deployments , check out this knowledge article .
for code coverage tips , see code coverage best practices in the force.com apex code developer 's guide .
predictable iteration order for unordered collections this update causes the iteration order of unordered collections ( map  and set ) to be deterministic .
when you activate this critical update , the order of elements in maps and sets is the same every time your code is run again .
this update can cause a different iteration order for maps and sets than the current order .
without this update , the order of elements in unordered collections is arbitrary — you ca n’t rely on the order of elements in maps and sets .
ideally , code should n’t depend on the order of elements in unordered collections .
if you have such code , it could sometimes fail before this update .
this update makes your code more robust because the iteration order in unordered collections is always the same .
this update affects all api versions .
after you apply this update , any code that exercises order - dependent logic on unordered collections could fail .
ensure that you fix any failures in your code .
for example , this snippet shows code that can fail if the order of map elements changes .
map
< string , string > currencymap = new map < string , string > ( ) ; currencymap.put('france','euro ' ) ; currencymap.put('japan ' , ' yen ' ) ; // convert the map to a string .
string currencies = string.valueof(currencymap ) ; //
this statement compares the string representation of the map // //
this assertion might fail if the order of the elements changes .
system.assertequals('{france = euro , japan = yen } ' , currencies ) ; to an expected string .

connectapi ( chatter in apex ) to create custom communities and chatter experiences in salesforce , use chatter in apex .
many chatter rest api resource actions are exposed as static methods on apex classes in the connectapi  namespace .
these methods use other connectapi  classes to input and return information .
the connectapi  namespace is referred to as chatter in apex .
in apex , it ’s possible to access some chatter data using soql queries and objects .
however , connectapi  classes expose chatter data in a much simpler way .
data is localized and structured for display .
for example , instead of making many calls to access and assemble a feed , you can do it with a single call .
note :  to integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third party web applications with chatter and communities , use chatter rest api .

this section : general updates to chatter in apex new and changed chatter in apex classes new and changed chatter in apex input classes new and changed chatter in apex output classes new and changed chatter in apex enums 281 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code general updates to chatter in apex integrate third - party and salesforce services into the feed with action links ( generally available )
an action link is a button on a feed element .
clicking an action link can take a user to another web page , initiate a file download , or invoke an api call to salesforce or to an external server .
an action link includes a url and an http method , and can include a request body and header information , such as an oauth token for authentication .
use action links to integrate salesforce and third - party services into the feed so that users can take action to drive productivity and accelerate innovation .
for example , let ’s imagine that a fictional 3d print shop called “ buildit ” creates an appexchange app that uses action links to integrate with salesforce .
if a buildit customer has the app installed , they can go to the buildit website , create an account , and send posts containing action links to salesforce that invite certain users to order parts from buildit .
in this sample feed element posted from buildit customer pam jones to her report jin chang , clicking the download action link downloads a file with parts information from the buildit website .
clicking the order action link takes jin chang to a page on the buildit website to order a part .
the workflow for instantiating action links and posting them with a feed element : ( optional ) create action link templates .
( create action link templates to distribute action links in apps explains this step . ) 1 . 2 .
call connectapi .
actionlinks.createactionlinkgroupdefinition(string , connectapi .
actionlinkgroupdefinitioninput )  to instantiate an action link group definition .
pass a community id and a connectapi .
actionlinkgroupdefinitioninput object that defines the action link group .
the response contains the id of the newly instantiated action link group , which you ’ll associate with a feed item in the next step .
3 .
call connectapi .
chatterfeeds.postfeedelement(string , connectapi .
feedelementinput , connectapi .
binaryinput )  to associate the action link with a feed item and post it .
pass a community id , a connectapi .
feediteminput  object that uses the action link group id returned from the previous step to associate the action link group with the feed item .
optionally , pass a connectapi .
binaryinput  object if you want to attach a binary file to the feed item , otherwise , pass null .
note :  the connectapi .
chatterfeeds.postfeedelement(string , connectapi .
feedelementinput , connectapi .
binaryinput )  method takes a connectapi .
feedelementinput  object , but that class is abstract and you ca n’t instantiate an object from an abstract class .
pass a concrete instance of the connectapi .
feediteminput subclass .
282 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code tip :  for detailed steps , see “ define action links and post with a feed element ” in apex code developer ’s guide .
create action link templates to distribute action links in apps create action link templates in setup so that you can instantiate action link groups with common properties from chatter rest api or apex .
you can package templates and distribute them to other salesforce organizations .
action link templates support binding variables , which are placeholders that allow variable data to be incorporated into action links when they ’re created from templates .
specify binding variables in the template and set their values when you instantiate the action link group from the template .
for example , use a binding variable for the api version number , a user id , or an oauth token .
action link templates also support context variables , which are placeholders that salesforce fills in to pass information about the user who executed the action link and the context in which it was invoked to your server - side code .
you can use binding variables and context variables in the action url , http request body , and http headers  fields of an action link template .
after an action link group template is published , you can move binding variables between these fields and you can delete them , but you ca n’t add new binding variables .
you can move , add , and delete context variables in these fields after a template is published .
you can also edit any other content in these fields after a template is published , but you ca n’t edit any other fields .
the workflow for instantiating action links from templates and posting them with a feed element : 1 .
create action link templates .
a. from setup ,
click create > action link templates and create an action link group template : b. every action link group should have at least one action link .
action link group templates and action link templates have a master - detail relationship .
create an action link template : 283 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code c. when you ’re done adding action link templates to the action link group template , return to the action link group template and publish it : 2 .
make a soql query to get the template id : actionlinkgrouptemplate template = [ select i d from actionlinkgrouptemplate where developername='doc_example'];. 3 .
call connectapi .
actionlinks.createactionlinkgroupdefinition(string , connectapi .
actionlinkgroupdefinitioninput )  to instantiate an action link group from a template .
specify the template id and the template bindings ( the keys and values for the binding variables ) in a connectapi .
actionlinkgroupdefinitioninput object .
the response contains the id of the newly instantiated action link group , which you ’ll associate with a feed item in the next step .
4 .
call connectapi .
chatterfeeds.postfeedelement(string , connectapi .
feedelementinput , connectapi .
binaryinput )  to post a feed item and associate the action link with it .
pass at connectapi .
feediteminput  object hat contains the body of the feed item and uses the action link group id returned in the previous step to associate the action link group with the feed item .
optionally , pass a connectapi .
binaryinput  object if you want to attach a binary file to the feed item , otherwise , pass null .
284 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code tip :  for detailed steps , see “ define action links in a template and post with a feed element ” in apex code developer ’s guide .
use action link context variables to pass context information to server - side code use context variables to pass information about the user who executed the action link and the context in which it was invoked into the http request made by invoking an action link .
you can use context variables in the actionurl , headers , and requestbody properties of the action link definition input request body or connectapi .
actionlinkdefinitioninput  object .
you can also use context variables in the action url , http request body , and http headers fields of action link templates .
you can edit these fields , including adding and removing context variables , after a template is published .
the context variables are : context variable { ! actionlinkid } { ! actionlinkgroupid } { ! communityid } { ! communityurl } { ! orgid } { !
userid } description the id of the action link the user executed .
the id of the action link group containing the action link the user executed .
the id of the community in which the user executed the action link .
the value for your internal organization is the empty key " 000000000000000000 " .
the url of the community in which the user executed the action link .
the value for your internal organization is empty string " " .
the id of the organization in which the user executed the action link .
the id of the user that executed the action link .
for example , suppose you work for a company called survey example and you create an app for the salesforce appexchange called “ survey example for salesforce . ”
company a has “
survey example for salesforce ” installed .
let ’s imagine that someone from company a goes to surveyexample.com and makes a survey .
your survey example server - side code creates a feed item in company a ’s salesforce organization with the body text “
take a survey , ” and an action link with the label “
ok ” .
if you include a { !
userid }  context variable in either the http request body  or the action url  for that action link , when a user clicks the action link in the feed , salesforce sends the id of the user who clicked .
if you include an { !
actionlinkid }  context variable in the survey example server - side code that creates the action link , salesforce responds with the id of the action link and you can save that to your database .
this example includes the { !
userid }  context variable in the action url  of the action link template : 285 salesforce spring ’15 release notes apex code tip :  binding variables and context variables can be used in the same field .
for example , this action url contains a binding variable and a context variable : https://www.example.com/{!bindings.apiversion}/dosurvey?salesforceuserid={!userid } action links classes , methods , and enums the new action links classes , methods , and enums are listed in these sections : • action links classes on page 287 •

an action link includes a url and an http method , and can include a request body and header information , such as an oauth token for authentication .
use action links to integrate salesforce and third - party services into the feed so that users can take action to drive productivity and accelerate innovation .
this new class has these properties : • actiontype — defines the type of action link .

– download —
the action link downloads a file from the action url . –
ui —
the action link takes the user to a web page at the action url .
note :  invoking apiasync action links from an app requires a call to set the status , and there is n’t currently a way to set the status of an action link using apex .
to set the status , use chatter rest api .
see the action link resource in the chatter rest api developer 's guide for more information .

the following system events are now available .
system events are fired by the framework during its lifecycle .
you can handle these events in your lightning apps or components , and within salesforce1 .
attribute name aura : donerendering aura : donewaiting aura : locationchange aura : noaccess aura : systemerror aura : valuechange aura : valuedestroy aura : valueinit description indicates that the initial rendering of the root application or root component has completed . indicates that the app or component is done waiting for a response to a server request .
this event is preceded by an aura : waiting  event .
indicates that the hash part of the url has changed .
indicates that a requested resource is not accessible due to security constraints on that resource .
indicates that an error has occurred .
indicates that a value has changed .
indicates that a value is being destroyed .
indicates that a value has been initialized . 298 salesforce spring ’15 release notes lightning components ( beta ) attribute name aura : waiting description indicates that the app or component is waiting for a response to a server request .
the following force  events are now available .
these events are handled by salesforce1 .
if you fire these events in your lightning apps or components outside of salesforce1 , you must handle them as necessary .
attribute name force : createrecord force : editrecord force : navigatetolist force : navigatetoobjecthome force : navigatetorelatedlist force : navigatetosobject force : navigatetourl force : recordsave force : recordsavesuccess force : refreshview force : showtoast the following ui  events are now available .

other changes in lightning components we ’ve made additional changes in lightning components .
in
this section : case sensitivity lightning components markup is now case sensitive . 299 salesforce spring ’15 release notes lightning components ( beta ) authoring support added in more editions authoring lightning components is supported in organizations besides developer edition organizations .
previously , enabling lightning components in other organization editions allowed lightning components to be used but not authored .
for some organizations , this added extra steps to being able to use lightning components they created in a new developer edition organization .
namespace requirement removed lightning components do n’t require your organization to have a namespace .
previously , lightning components required you to set a namespace for your organization .
this could be a burden for smaller organizations that preferred to avoid the complexity that having a namespace entails .
support added for default namespace lightning components support a default namespace for organizations with and without a namespace set .
previously , lightning components required all references to components , custom objects and fields , and apex classes to explicitly include the namespace for your organization .
this required extra work and attention to detail , even for simple or even trivial components .
extend lightning components and apps a lightning component can now extend another lightning component .
similarly , a lightning app can extend another lightning app .
this takes the concept of inheritance from object - oriented programming and applies it to presentation layer development .
referential integrity validation
added changes to lightning components and component dependencies are validated when saved to ensure those changes do n’t break existing code .
support for lightning components in the lightning app builder and lightning pages you can now configure your custom lightning components to be usable by the lightning app builder and lightning pages .
load external css or javascript libraries to reference external css or an external javascript library that you ’ve uploaded as a static resource , use the < ltng : require > tag in your .cmp  or .app  markup .
case sensitivity lightning components markup is now case sensitive .
previously , lightning components markup was case insensitive except for references to javascript or css .
with spring ’15 , case sensitivity should be respected in your markup .
expressions are also case sensitive .
for example , if you have a custom field mynamespace__amount__c , you must refer to it as { !
v.myobject.mynamespace__amount__c}. authoring support added in more editions authoring lightning components is supported in organizations besides developer edition organizations .
previously , enabling lightning components in other organization editions allowed lightning components to be used but not authored .
for some organizations , this added extra steps to being able to use lightning components they created in a new developer edition organization .
you can now author lightning components in all of the same editions where visualforce is authored : contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions .
in all organizations lightning components are authored in the developer console .
namespace requirement removed lightning components do n’t require your organization to have a namespace .
previously , lightning components required you to set a namespace for your organization .
this could be a burden for smaller organizations that preferred to avoid the complexity that having a namespace entails .
300 salesforce spring ’15 release notes lightning components ( beta ) with spring ’15 , lightning components can be enabled in organizations that do n’t have a namespace configured .
a default namespace is used in these organizations to simplify your authoring experience .
support added for default namespace lightning components support a default namespace for organizations with and without a namespace set .
previously , lightning components required all references to components , custom objects and fields , and apex classes to explicitly include the namespace for your organization .
this required extra work and attention to detail , even for simple or even trivial components .
with spring ’15 lightning components can use the “ c ” namespace in place of their organization ’s namespace .
this simplifies the code , making it more readable , and it makes the code more portable to other organizations via cut - and - paste ( for example , from blog posts ) or via unmanaged packages .
organizations without a namespace set must use the “ c ” namespace .
setting and using your namespace is a best practice for larger organizations and those that plan to offer or use third - party code — that is , use managed packages from the appexchange , or offer their own packages on the appexchange .
for complete details of using namespaces with lightning components , refer to the lightning components developer ’s guide .
extend lightning components and apps a lightning component can now extend another lightning component .
similarly , a lightning app can extend another lightning app .
this takes the concept of inheritance from object - oriented programming and applies it to presentation layer development .
a component that extends another component inherits the attributes and registered events of the super component .
for more details on inheritance behavior , see the lightning components developer ’s guide .
these system attributes are now available in the < aura : component >  and < aura : application > tags .
extensible set to true  if the component or application can be extended .
defaults to false .
for example : < aura : component extensible="true " > extends the component or application to be extended .
for example : < aura : component extends="ui : message " > abstract
set to true  if the component or application is abstract .
defaults to false .
for example : < aura : component abstract="true " > object - oriented languages , such as java , support the concept of an abstract class that provides a partial implementation for an object but leaves the remaining implementation to concrete sub - classes .
an abstract class in java ca n't be instantiated directly , but a non - abstract subclass can .
similarly , the lightning component framework supports the concept of abstract components that have a partial implementation but leave the remaining implementation to concrete sub - components .
to use an abstract component , you must extend it and fill out the remaining implementation .
an abstract component ca n't be used directly in markup .
referential integrity validation
added changes to lightning components and component dependencies are validated when saved to ensure those changes do n’t break existing code .
component names , custom object and field names , class names , and so on can all be referenced in your lightning components markup .
when they change — for example , if you change the name of a custom component — code that references the changed item needs to change along with it .
in some cases — for example , changing the name of a custom object — these changes can be made automatically , 301 salesforce spring ’15 release notes lightning components ( beta ) and happen behind the scenes .
in others , you need to make code changes manually .
in those cases , you ’ll receive a compilation error when you try to save the incompatible change .
previously , lightning component dependencies were n’t included in the referential integrity validation that ’s built into salesforce , and which protects your visualforce and apex code .
spring ’15 begins the process of adding this layer of protection to lightning components .
while the safety net is n’t yet as complete as for apex and visualforce , it should be substantially more difficult to make changes that cause existing code to stop working .
support for lightning components in the lightning app builder and lightning pages you can now configure your custom lightning components to be usable by the lightning app builder and lightning pages .
editions note :  the lightning app builder is currently available to select customers through a pilot program .
to be nominated to join this pilot program , contact salesforce .
additional terms and conditions may apply to participate in the pilot program .
please note that pilot programs are subject to change , and as such , we can not guarantee acceptance into this pilot program or a particular time frame in which this feature can be enabled .
any unreleased services or features referenced in this document , press releases , or public statements are not currently available and may not be delivered on time or at all .
customers who purchase our services should make their purchase decisions based upon features that are currently available .
available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions here ’s what you need to do : implement this interface in your lightning component : flexipage : availableforallpagetypes . 1 . 2 .
add a design file to your component bundle .
a design file describes the design - time behavior of a lightning component —
information that visual tools need to allow adding the component to a page or app .
3 .
( optional ) include an svg file in your component bundle .
you can use an svg file to define a custom icon for your component when it appears in the lightning app builder ’s component pane .
here ’s the sample code for a simple “ hello world ” component .
< aura : component implements="flexipage : availableforallpagetypes " > < aura : attribute name="greeting " type="string " default="hello " / > < aura : attribute name="subject " type="string " default="world " / > < div style="box " > < span class="greeting">{!v.greeting}</span > , { ! v.subject }
! < /div > < /aura : component >
here ’s the design resource that goes in the bundle with the “ hello world ” component .
< design : component > < design : attribute name="subject " label="subject " description="name of the person you want to greet " / > < design : attribute name="greeting " label="greeting " type="picklist " datasource="hello , hola , bienvenue , shalom " / > < /design : component >
for full details , see the lightning components developer ’s guide .
302 salesforce spring ’15 release notes api load external css or javascript libraries to reference external css or an external javascript library that you ’ve uploaded as a static resource , use the < ltng : require >  tag in your .cmp  or .app  markup .
for example : < ltng : require scripts=" / resource / jslibone,/resource / jslibtwo " styles=" / resource / cssone,/resource / csstwo " afterscriptsloaded="{!c.afterscriptsloaded}"/ >
the comma - separated lists of resources are loaded in the order that they are entered in the scripts  and styles attributes .
the afterscriptsloaded  action in the client - side controller is called after the scripts are loaded .
to ensure encapsulation and reusability , add the < ltng : require >  tag to every .cmp  or .app
resource that uses the css or javascript library .

lastreferenceddate • lastvieweddate rest api rest api includes new features , new resources , and changed resources in version 33.0 .
insert and update blob data ( generally available )
previously we piloted a rest feature that enabled you to use the sobject basic information and sobject rows resources to upload files with a size of up to 500 mb to salesforce standard objects .
the feature is now generally available , and the maximum file size has been increased to 2 gb for files that are uploaded to salesforce crm content .
now you can manage large file uploads by using rest api .
use cors to access rest api cors ( cross - origin resource sharing ) is a w3c recommendation that enables web browsers to request resources from origins other than their own ( cross - origin requests ) .
for example , using cors , a javascript script at https://www.example.com  can request a resource from https://www.salesforce.com .
310 salesforce spring ’15 release notes api rest api now supports cors .
to access this api from javascript in a web browser , add the origin that ’s serving the script to the cors whitelist .
to add an origin to the cors whitelist , from setup , choose security controls > cors .
click new , and then enter an origin url pattern .
the origin url pattern must include https and a domain name and may include a port .
the wildcard character ( * ) is supported and must precede a second - level domain name .
for example , https://*.example.com  adds all the subdomains of example.com to the whitelist .
if a browser that supports cors makes a request from an origin in the salesforce cors whitelist , salesforce returns the origin in the access - control - allow - origin  http header , along with any additional cors http headers .
if the origin is n’t in the whitelist , salesforce returns http status code 403 .
you must still pass an oauth token with requests that require it .
new resources limits resource /vxx.x / limits
previously we piloted the limits resource for retrieving limits information for your organization , enabling you to conveniently track your remaining number of api calls , number of events , and storage amounts .
the limits resource is now generally available in rest api version 29.0 and later for api users with the “ view setup and configuration ” permission .
additionally , the resource can now be used to retrieve the following limits information . •
daily generic streaming events ( if generic streaming is enabled for your organization ) • concurrent rest api requests for results of asynchronous report runs • concurrent synchronous report runs via rest api • hourly asynchronous report runs via rest api • hourly synchronous report runs via rest api • hourly dashboard refreshes via rest api • hourly rest api requests for dashboard results • hourly dashboard status requests via rest api • daily workflow emails •
hourly workflow time triggers this resource will be available within 24 hours after the spring ’15 release .
sobject platformaction resource /vxx.x / sobjects / platformaction platformaction is a virtual read - only object that enables you to query for actions — such as standard and custom buttons , quick actions , and productivity actions — that should be displayed in a ui , given a user , a context , device format , and a record id .
list invocable apex actions resource get /vxx.x / actions / custom / apex returns a list of all available invocable apex actions .
apex invocable actions provide a way to encapsulate pieces of logic in an apex method that can be used anywhere you can use apex .

solution • workflowrule query resource explain parameter you can now use the query resource to get feedback on how salesforce optimizes the query for a report or list view .
you do this by using a report or list view id instead of a query string when using the query resource with the explain  parameter .
here ’s an example using a report id : /services / data / v33.0/query/?explain=00od0000001hczmmau the response from the query resource has been improved to include additional details on salesforce optimizations .
these details are provided in the notes field of the response json data .

chatter rest api use chatter rest api to integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third party web applications with communities and with chatter .
note :  to create custom chatter and communities experiences in salesforce , use connectapi ( chatter in apex ) .
in
this section : general updates to chatter rest api new and changed chatter rest api resources new and changed chatter rest api request bodies new and changed chatter rest api response bodies general updates to chatter rest api integrate third - party and salesforce services into the feed with action links ( generally available )
an action link is a button on a feed element .
clicking an action link can take a user to another web page , initiate a file download , or invoke an api call to salesforce or to an external server .
an action link includes a url and an http method , and can include a request body and header information , such as an oauth token for authentication .
use action links to integrate salesforce and third - party services into the feed so that users can take action to drive productivity and accelerate innovation .
for example , let ’s imagine that a fictional 3d print shop called “ buildit ” creates an appexchange app that uses action links to integrate with salesforce .
if a buildit customer has the app installed , they can go to the buildit website , create an account , and send posts containing action links to salesforce that invite certain users to order parts from buildit .
in this sample feed element posted from buildit customer pam jones to her report jin chang , clicking the download action link downloads a file with parts information from the buildit website .
clicking the order action link takes jin chang to a page on the buildit website to order a part . 314 salesforce spring ’15 release notes api
the workflow for instantiating action links and posting them with a feed element : ( optional ) create action link templates .
( create action link templates to distribute action links in apps explains this step . ) 1 .
2 . make a post request to /services / data / v33.0/connect / action - link - group - definitions  and pass the action link group definition input request body to instantiate an action link group definition .
the response contains the id of the newly instantiated action link group , which you ’ll associate with a feed item in the next step .
3 . make a post request to /services / data / v33.0/chatter / feed - elements  and pass the feed item input request body .
use the action link group id returned in the previous step to associate the action link group with a feed element and post the feed element .
tip :
for detailed steps , see “ define action links and post with a feed element ” in chatter rest api developer ’s guide .
create action link templates to distribute action links in apps create action link templates in setup so that you can instantiate action link groups with common properties from chatter rest api or apex .
you can package templates and distribute them to other salesforce organizations .
action link templates support binding variables , which are placeholders that allow variable data to be incorporated into action links when they ’re created from templates .
specify binding variables in the template and set their values when you instantiate the action link group from the template .
for example , use a binding variable for the api version number , a user id , or an oauth token .
action link templates also support context variables , which are placeholders that salesforce fills in to pass information about the user who executed the action link and the context in which it was invoked to your server - side code .
you can use binding variables and context variables in the action url , http request body , and http headers  fields of an action link template .
after an action link group template is published , you can move binding variables between these fields and you can delete them , but you ca n’t add new binding variables .
you can move , add , and delete context variables in these fields after a template is published .
you can also edit any other content in these fields after a template is published , but you ca n’t edit any other fields .
the workflow for instantiating action links from templates and posting them with a feed element : 1 .
create action link templates .
a. from setup ,
click create > action link templates and create an action link group template : 315 salesforce spring ’15 release notes api b. every action link group should have at least one action link .
action link group templates and action link templates have a master - detail relationship .
create an action link template : c. when you ’re done adding action link templates to the action link group template , return to the action link group template and publish it : 316 salesforce spring ’15 release notes api 2 .
make a soql query to get the template id : /services / data / v33.0/query?q = select+id+from+actionlinkgrouptemplate+where+developername='doc_example ' .
3 . make a request to post /services
/ data / v33.0/connect / action - link - group - definitions  to instantiate an action link group from a template .
specify the template id and the template bindings ( the keys and values for the binding variables ) in an action link definition input request body .
the response contains the id of the newly instantiated action link group , which you ’ll associate with a feed item in the next step .
4 . make a request to post /services / data / v33.0/chatter / feed - elements .
in the feed item input request body , specify the action link group id to associate the action link with the feed item .
tip :
for detailed steps , see “ define action links in a template and post with a feed element ” in chatter rest api developer ’s guide .
use action link context variables to pass context information to server - side code use context variables to pass information about the user who executed the action link and the context in which it was invoked into the http request made by invoking an action link .
you can use context variables in the actionurl , headers , and requestbody properties of the action link definition input request body or connectapi .
actionlinkdefinitioninput  object .
you can also use context variables in the action url , http request body , and http headers fields of action link templates .
you can edit these fields , including adding and removing context variables , after a template is published .
the context variables are : context variable { ! actionlinkid } { ! actionlinkgroupid } { ! communityid } { ! communityurl } description the id of the action link the user executed .
the id of the action link group containing the action link the user executed .
the id of the community in which the user executed the action link .
the value for your internal organization is the empty key " 000000000000000000 " .
the url of the community in which the user executed the action link .
the value for your internal organization is empty string " " . 317 salesforce spring ’15 release notes api context variable { ! orgid } { !
userid } description the id of the organization in which the user executed the action link .
the id of the user that executed the action link .
for example , suppose you work for a company called survey example and you create an app for the salesforce appexchange called “ survey example for salesforce . ”
company a has “
survey example for salesforce ” installed .
let ’s imagine that someone from company a goes to surveyexample.com and makes a survey .
your survey example server - side code creates a feed item in company a ’s salesforce organization with the body text “
take a survey , ” and an action link with the label “
ok ” .
if you include a { !
userid }  context variable in either the http request body  or the action url  for that action link , when a user clicks the action link in the feed , salesforce sends the id of the user who clicked .
if you include an { !
actionlinkid }  context variable in the survey example server - side code that creates the action link , salesforce responds with the id of the action link and you can save that to your database .
this example includes the { !
userid }  context variable in the action url  of the action link template : tip :  binding variables and context variables can be used in the same field .
for example , this action url contains a binding variable and a context variable : https://www.example.com/{!bindings.apiversion}/dosurvey?salesforceuserid={!userid } migrate from action links pilot to generally available there are a few new properties in api version 33.0 .
in addition , some property values have changed .
these topics list the changes : • action links request bodies on page 321 •
action links response bodies on page 323 318 salesforce spring ’15 release notes api get bundled posts with aggregated feed tracked changes ( generally available ) bundled posts aggregate feed tracked changes made within ten minutes of each other into a single generic feed element so that the feed is easier to read .
for more information on this feature in the salesforce1 mobile browser app , see see multiple record updates bundled into one post .
bundled posts are returned by requests to resources that represent feed elements in a feed , for example , get /chatter / feeds / news / me / feed - elements .
a bundle is a generic feed element with a bundle capability .
the bundle layout elements are : 1 .
header —
the bundle displays the header  of the generic feed element response body .
for this bundle , this text is acme , corp. was updated ..
the time below the header is the relativecreateddate  property .
2 .
auxiliary body —
the bundle displays the fieldname and the oldvalue  and newvalue  properties for the first two feed tracked change response bodies nested in the tracked change bundle capability of the feed element .
if there are more than two feed - tracked changes , the bundle displays a show all updates link .
use cors ( cross - origin resource sharing ) to access salesforce resources from javascript cors is a w3c recommendation that enables web browsers to request resources from origins other than their own ( cross - origin requests ) .
for example , using cors , a javascript script at https://www.example.com could request a resource from https://www.salesforce.com .
in spring ‘ 15 , cors is enabled for all organizations and is also supported by rest api .

the first lets you disable retries for unfinished batches included in a bulk job .
the second lets you specify how salesforce reads line endings when you upload data .
the third lets you enable automatic primary key ( pk ) chunking for bulk queries .
batch retry header when you create a bulk job , the batch retry request header lets you disable retries for unfinished batches included in the job .
use this header to limit the batch processing time for batches that consistently time out .
326 salesforce spring ’15 release notes api the following example disables retries for batches included in the new job : sforce - disable - batch - retry : true line ending header
when you ’re creating a bulk upload job , the line ending request header lets you specify whether line endings are read as line feeds ( lfs ) or as carriage returns and line feeds ( crlfs ) for fields of type text area  and text area ( long ) .
the following example specifies that line endings are read as crlfs : sforce - line - ending : crlf pk chunking header use the pk chunking request header to enable automatic primary key ( pk ) chunking for a bulk query .
pk chunking splits bulk queries on very large tables into chunks based on the record ids , or primary keys , of the queried records .
each chunk is processed as a separate batch that counts toward your daily batch limit , and its results must be downloaded separately .
pk chunking is supported for the following objects : account , campaign , campaignmember , case , contact , lead , loginhistory , opportunity , task , user , and custom objects .
salesforce recommends that you enable pk chunking when querying tables with more than 10 million records or when a bulk query consistently times out .
however , the effectiveness of pk chunking depends on the specifics of the query and the queried data .
the following example enables pk chunking with a chunk size of 50,000 records : sforce - enable - pkchunking : chunksize=50000 streaming api streaming api includes a new feature , generic streaming , in version 33.0 .
generic streaming ( generally available )
previously we piloted generic streaming , a streaming api feature that lets you send notifications for events that are n’t tied to salesforce data changes .
you can use generic streaming to send custom notifications to specific teams or to your entire organization , or send notifications for events that are external to salesforce .
generic streaming is now generally available .
for details , see the force.com streaming api developer ’s guide
. this feature will be available within 24 hours after the spring ’15 release .
tooling api use the tooling api to build custom development tools for salesforce applications .
changes in tooling api version 33.0 include the following new features : feature metadata namespace description in previous versions of the soap tooling api , metadata type elements were defined in the same namespace as the sobjects of the api , tooling.soap.sforce.com .
in order to uniquely name these types , the suffix “ metadata ” was appended to the metadata types .
in this version of the api , a new namespace is introduced , metadata.tooling.soap.sforce.com , and the suffix is no longer used .
the old names will continue to work with clients against older api endpoints .
sosl support the tooling api adds sosl ( salesforce object search language ) support .
changes in tooling api version 33.0 include the following new objects : 327 salesforce spring ’15 release notes api object autoresponserule description there are new autoresponserule and assignmentrule objects in the mns  namespace .
the earlier autoresponserule and assignmentrule objects are still available in the tns namespace .

in
this section : save time with default sso
when connecting an organization to the environment hub when you connect an organization to the environment hub , single sign - on ( sso ) is enabled by default , saving you the time and effort of setting up sso manually .
keep track of member organizations with descriptions in environment hub are you getting lost in a long list of member organizations in the environment hub ?
add a description of each hub member to make it easier for you to keep track of the organizations that you ’ve connected to the hub .
streamline managed packages by deleting unused components when updating a managed package , you can now delete visualforce pages , visualforce components , and static resources .
by removing components that are no longer used by the app , you reduce its complexity and help create a more streamlined user experience for your subscribers .
the ability to delete these components builds on similar functionality that was introduced in the spring ’14 release .
package named credentials the named credential component is now available in managed and unmanaged packages .
add a named credential to a package to enable authenticated apex callouts in the subscriber organization to specify the named credential as the callout endpoint .
doing so enables salesforce to handle all the authentication securely for those callouts , so that the apex code does n’t have to .
save time with default sso
when connecting an organization to the environment hub when you connect an organization to the environment hub , single sign - on ( sso ) is enabled by default , saving you the time and effort of setting up sso manually .
editions previously , if you wanted to enable sso for an environment hub member , you needed to do so after connecting the organization to the environment hub .
now , when you connect an organization to the environment hub , sso is enabled by default .
of course , if you ’d prefer to enable sso yourself at a later time , you can disable this option before you connect the organization .
available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited keep track of member organizations with descriptions in environment hub are you getting lost in a long list of member organizations in the environment hub ?
add a description of each hub member to make it easier for you to keep track of the organizations that you ’ve connected to the hub .
editions if your environment hub has many members , or if members have similar names , keeping track of which organization is which can be challenging .
now you can add a description to each hub member — up to 4,000 characters — to distinguish it from the other members .
the field is optional , so if you ’re happy with how you currently track and manage your hub members , simply leave it empty . 335 available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited salesforce spring ’15 release notes isvforce streamline managed packages by deleting unused components when updating a managed package , you can now delete visualforce pages , visualforce components , and static resources .
by removing components that are no longer used by the app , you reduce its complexity and help create a more streamlined user experience for your subscribers .
the ability to delete these components builds on similar functionality that was introduced in the spring ’14 release .
editions available in : • developer note :  this feature is available to eligible salesforce partners .
for more information on the partner program , including eligibility requirements , visit www.salesforce.com/partners .
previously , these components could n’t be deleted from managed packages .
however , in complex packages , the number of components can grow very large over multiple release cycles .
in such cases , deleting unused managed components allows you to keep your app clutter - free while you maintain and upgrade it .
important : • deleting any component permanently deletes any data that exists in that component , deletes tracked history data , and changes any integrations that rely on the component , such as assignment or escalation rules .
also , once you delete a component in a managed package , you ca n’t restore it or create another component with the same api name .
however , no data or metadata is ever deleted in a subscriber organization without specific action by the customer .
subscribers who upgrade to the new package version still have the deleted components available in their organization .
they ’re displayed in the unused components section of the package details page .
this ensures that subscribers have the opportunity to export data and modify custom integrations that involve those components before explicitly deleting them . •
it ’s your responsibility to educate your customers about the potential impact of any components that you delete .
salesforce recommends that you list all deleted custom components and notify customers of any required actions in the release notes for your upgraded package .
the following restrictions apply when deleting managed components . •
if a component is referenced by any other metadata , such as workflow rules , validation rules , or apex classes , you ca n’t delete that component .
you can delete managed components , both declaratively , from the user interface , and programmatically , using the metadata api .
in the latter case , specify the components you want to delete in a destructivechanges.xml  manifest file and then use the standard deploy ( )  call .
the process is identical to that for deleting components that are n’t managed .
for more information about the api , see the metadata api developer ’s guide .
for more information about deleting components in managed packages , see the isvforce guide .
package named credentials the named credential component is now available in managed and unmanaged packages .
add a named credential to a package to enable authenticated apex callouts in the subscriber organization to specify the named credential as the callout endpoint .
doing so enables salesforce to handle all the authentication securely for those callouts , so that the apex code does n’t have to .
consider the following . •
named credentials are n’t automatically added to packages .
if you package apex code that specifies a named credential as a callout endpoint , also add the named credential to that package or otherwise make sure that the subscriber organization has a valid named credential with the same name .
editions available in : • group •
professional • • performance • unlimited • developer enterprise if you have multiple organizations , you can create a named credential with the same name in each organization .
each of these named credentials can have a different endpoint url , for example , to accommodate differences 336 salesforce spring ’15 release notes other changes in force.com development in development and production environments .
because the code references only the name of the named credential , the same apex class can be packaged and deployed in all your organizations without the code having to programmatically check the environment .
• certificates are n’t packageable .
if you package a named credential that specifies a certificate , make sure that the subscriber organization has a valid certificate with the same name . •
after installation from a managed or unmanaged package , the subscriber must reauthenticate to the external system . –
for password authentication , the subscriber must re - enter the password in the named credential definition . –
for oauth , the subscriber must update the callback url in the client configuration for the authentication provider and then reauthenticate by selecting start authentication flow on save  on the named credential .
attributes of named credentials in a managed package this table shows which attributes of a named credential are editable after installation from a managed package .
• developer editable : the developer can edit the component attributes in this column .
these attributes are locked in the subscriber ’s organization . • subscriber and developer editable :
the subscriber and developer can edit the component attributes in this column .
however , these attributes are n’t upgradeable .
only new subscribers receive the latest changes . •

the salesforce1 platform has made salesforce a market leader in crm .
custom metadata types and custom metadata give you the power to build an ecosystem for your apps , like salesforce has done for ours .
if you ’ve tried to build your own platform - like features by using custom settings and custom objects , you realize that custom - setting and custom - object data ca n’t be packaged , deployed , upgraded , or customized in a manageable way .
if you want to provide your customers and partners with audit capability , metadata can provide an audit trail for debugging .
( field history tracking ca n’t be packaged . )
if you want to build security into your apps , custom metadata types enable simplified profile administration .
( custom settings are tied to profiles and ca n’t be easily tied to permission sets . )
as of spring ’15 , custom metadata types let you : • create custom metadata types and records in developer edition , enterprise edition , performance edition , unlimited edition , or database.com edition organizations .
• package custom metadata types and records in unmanaged packages , managed packages , or managed package extensions . •
deploy packages that contain custom metadata types and records to developer edition , enterprise edition , performance edition , unlimited edition , or database.com edition organizations that are part of the custom metadata types pilot .
• use change sets to deploy custom metadata types and records from a sandbox . •
use all field types that are available in custom settings , except for currency fields , in custom metadata types . • expose custom metadata in the application cache for efficient access without the cost of repeated queries to the database .
• read custom metadata types and records in apex .
use the getbyname ( ) , getbynames ( ) , and getallnames ( )  methods to retrieve the api names of the custom metadata records on your custom metadata types .
for example , you can : – retrieve a record that ’s called ourcustommdinstance1_md  from the ourcustommetadata_mdt  type by using getbyname ( ) .
public class getbynamewithexistingcmd { public static void testgetbyname ( ) { custommetadata .
ourcustommetadata__mdt cmd = custommetadata . ourcustommetadata__mdt.getbyname('ourcustommdinstance1__md ' ) ; } } 338 salesforce spring ’15 release notes help and training – retrieve a record that ’s called ourcustommdinstance1_md  from the ourcustommetadata_mdt  type by using getbyname ( ) , and then assign the value of that record ’s datetime__c  custom field to a datetime  variable that ’s called fromcmd .
public class customfieldtests { public static void testcustomfields ( ) { custommetadata .
ourcustommetadata__mdt cmd = custommetadata . ourcustommetadata__mdt.getbyname('ourcustommdinstance1__md ' ) ; datetime fromcmd = cmd.datetime__c ; } } – retrieve all records from the ourcustommetadata_mdt  type by using getallnames ( ) , assign them to a set < string >  variable that ’s called allnames , and then list them using a string  variable called allnameslist .
public class getbynamesusinggetallnames { public static void testgetallnames ( ) { set < string > allnames = custommetadata . ourcustommetadata__mdt.getallnames ( ) ; string allnameslist = '' ; for ( string name : allnames ) { allnameslist + = name + ' ' ; } } } – retrieve two records from the ourcustommetadata_mdt  type by using getbynames ( ) , assign them to a map < string , custommetadata .
ourcustommetadata__mdt >  variable that ’s called cmdmap , and then assign the values of those records to variables that are called cmd  and cmd2 .
public class getbynamesusinggetallnames { public static void testgetallnames ( ) { set < string > allnames = custommetadata . ourcustommetadata__mdt.getallnames ( ) ; map < string , custommetadata . ourcustommetadata__mdt > cmdmap = custommetadata .
ourcustommetadata__mdt.getbynames(allnames ) ; custommetadata .
ourcustommetadata__mdt cmd = cmdmap.get('ourcustommdinstance1__md ' ) ; custommetadata .
ourcustommetadata__mdt cmd2 = cmdmap.get('ourcustommdinstance2__md ' ) ; } } custom metadata types enable you to create your own declarative developer frameworks for internal teams , partners , and customers .
rather than building apps from data , you can build apps that are defined and driven by their own types of metadata .
contact salesforce for more information on joining the custom metadata types pilot , or join the custom platform community group at success.salesforce.com  to discuss this exciting new functionality .
