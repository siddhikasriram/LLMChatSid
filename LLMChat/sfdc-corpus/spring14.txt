using topics to organize records enable topics for objects to allow users to add topics to records .
adding topics helps organize records and makes them easier to find . 32 general enhancements enable and configure topics for objects
although topics for objects can be an extension of the chatter topics features you already use , chatter is not required to enable topics for objects .
for existing organizations , topics are n’t enabled for any objects by default .
administrators must choose which objects to enable .
enabling topics for an object allows users to add topics to records of that object type .
warning :  enabling topics for an object disables public tags on records of that object type , and the public tags are n’t migrated to topics .
personal tags are n’t affected .
if administrators disable topics for an object , all public tags on records of that object type are restored .
for organizations created after the spring ’14 release , topics are enabled for all available standard objects by default .
administrators must choose which custom objects to enable .
these organizations do n’t have public tags on records .
after administrators enable topics for objects , users can add topics to records and retrieve them using list views .
for example , if you met a number of contacts at a conference , you might add the topic user conference 2014 to their records .
you could then use the user conference 2014 topic to filter a contacts list view to retrieve those records .
enable and configure topics for objects enable topics for objects , even if you do n’t have chatter , so users can add topics to records to organize them by common themes .
available in : all editions to enable topics for objects : “ customize application ”
user permissions needed administrators can enable topics for accounts , assets , campaigns , cases , contacts , contracts , events , leads , opportunities , tasks , and custom objects .
warning :  when topics are enabled for an object , public tags are disabled for records of that object type .
when topics are enabled for an object , administrators optionally can configure topic suggestions to use the text from specific fields on that object . 1 .
from setup , click customize > topics > topics for objects . 2 .
select an object .
3 .
select enable topics for object .
4 .
for custom objects , select the text fields that you want to use for topic suggestions .
for standard objects , optionally deselect use topic suggestions from default fields to see all the fields you can use for topic suggestions .
select use 33 general enhancements add topics to records topic suggestions from default fields to use only the object ’s default set of text fields ( typically name and description fields ) . 5 .
click save to save changes for all objects .
after administrators enable topics for an object , users with the appropriate topics permissions can : see topic assignments and suggestions on records of that object type that they have access to •
• add and remove topics from records of that object type that they have access to • use topics on records of that object type to filter their list views additionally , if your organization uses chatter , users can click topics assigned to records to go to topic pages and discover related information , including posts and comments , files , groups talking about topics , and people who are knowledgeable about topics .
add topics to records add topics to records to organize them by common themes and retrieve them in list views .
available in : all editions to add existing topics to a record : to add new topics to a record : “ read ” on the record and “ assign topics ” “ read ” on the record and “ create topics ”
user permissions needed topics for objects must be enabled before you can add topics to records of that object type .
note :  all topic names are public and appear in search results , but this does n’t affect the visibility of records that have topics . 1 .
on the top of the record detail page under the record name , click click to add topics .
if the record already has topics , click topics .
if your administrator enabled feed - based layouts , click add topics in the sidebar of the feed view .
34 general enhancements topics in list views 2 .
in the topic editor , start typing your text .
as you type , you can pick a topic from the list of suggestions , or keep typing to create your own unique topic .
to add more than one topic , type a comma after each topic .
commas ( , ) and closing square brackets ( ] ) automatically end a topic .
other punctuation , symbols , and separators are supported in topic names .
records can have up to 100 topics .
3 .
when you ’re done adding topics , click done or press enter .
you can now use topics you added to records to filter your list views .
if your administrator enabled chatter , the topics you add to records become links to topic detail pages .
topic detail pages do n’t display any information about records that have the topic , but they can provide valuable information , such as people who are knowledgeable about the topic and groups that are talking about the topic .
chatter posts on a record do n’t automatically have a relationship to topics you add to that record , unless you also add the same topics to posts on that record .
topics in list views use topics to filter your list views .
available in : all editions if topics are enabled for an object , you can use the topics field to filter your list views for the object .
35 general enhancements improved previews for microsoft powerpoint® ( .pptx ) presentations you ca n’t use filter logic if your field filters use the topics field .
the topics field is n’t available as a field you can display in your list views .
improved previews for microsoft powerpoint® ( .pptx ) presentations the technology that renders powerpoint® file previews has been greatly improved .
previews of presentations now render with noticeably higher quality inside the browser .
available in : all editions note :  improved previews are available in some organizations now , and will gradually become automatically available in all organizations by the summer of 2014 .
we ’ve also fixed an issue with graphic elements displaying incorrectly on a slide .
36 general enhancements file storage per paid user license increased from 612 mb to 2 gb for enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions figure 1
: before figure 2 : after file storage per paid user license increased from 612 mb to 2 gb for enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions file storage limits have increased for enterprise , performance , and unlimited edition organizations .
review the current per - user and per - organization limits for file storage and data storage .
37 general enhancements file storage per paid user license increased from 612 mb to 2 gb for enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions available in : enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions note :  increased file storage is available within one month after spring ’14 .
each edition offers a minimum amount of data storage and file storage .
file storage includes files in attachments , the documents tab , the files tab , the file field , salesforce crm content , chatter ( including user photos ) , and site.com assets .
data storage includes the following : • accounts • article types ( format : “ [ article type name ] ” ) • article type translations ( format : “ [ article type name ] version ” ) •
campaigns • campaign members • cases • case teams • contacts • contracts • custom objects • email messages • events • forecast items • google docs • ideas •
leads • notes • opportunities • opportunity splits • quotes • quote template rich text data • • tags : tag applications • tags :
unique tags •
tasks solutions for file storage , contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions are allocated a per - user limit multiplied by the number of users in the organization plus an additional per - organization allocation .
for example , an enterprise edition organization with 600 users receives 1,211 gb of file storage , or 2 gb per user multiplied by 600 users plus an additional 11 gb .
a professional edition organization with 600 users receives about 370 gb of file storage , or 612 mb per user multiplied by 600 users plus an additional 11 gb .
for data storage , contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions are allocated either 1 gb or a per - user limit , whichever is greater .
for example , a professional edition organization with 10 users receives 1 gb because 10 users multiplied by 20 mb per user is 200 mb , which is less than the 1 gb minimum .
a professional edition organization with 100 users receives more than the 1 gb minimum because 100 users multiplied by 20 mb per user is 2,000 mb .
the values in the storage allocation per user license columns below apply to salesforce and salesforce platform user licenses .

if your search for a record returns a large number of matches , such as a user with a common name , you can instead query all searchable fields for that record to narrow your results .
in the enhanced lookup search dialog , select all fields and enter other search terms unique to the record , such as the user ’s email address .
for more information about name fields and searchable fields per object , see “ searchable fields in lookup searches ” and “ searchable fields by object ” in the salesforce help .
auto - saving of records with lookup values now supports enhanced lookup searches when users are editing a record , if they enter a value in a lookup field then save the record without clicking the lookup icon , salesforce now automatically performs an enhanced lookup search on the name fields if the object is configured to use enhanced lookups .
here ’s what can result from the lookup search . •
one exact match — assigns that value to the lookup field and automatically saves the record •
more than one possible match —
displays a drop - down list of matches for users to select from •
no matches — displays an error for more information on enhanced lookups , see “ lookup dialog search ” and “ searchable fields in lookup searches ” in the salesforce help .

tip :
before exposing existing visualforce pages in the salesforce1 app , consider how they ’ll look and function on mobile phones and tablets .
most likely , you ’ll want to create a new page that ’s designed specifically for mobile form factors .
visualforce pages must be enabled for mobile use before they can display in these areas of the salesforce1 user interface : • the navigation menu , via a visualforce tab •
the publisher , via a custom action 67 mobile set up your organization to use the salesforce1 app • mobile cards on a record ’s related information page • overridden standard buttons , or custom buttons and links • embedded in record detail page layouts to enable a visualforce page for salesforce1 : 1 .

the salesforce classic ready checkbox on visualforce tab setup pages is for salesforce classic only and has no effect on visualforce pages in the salesforce1 apps .
compact layout overview compact layouts are used in salesforce1 to display a record 's key fields at a glance .
compact layouts are designed for viewing records on touchscreen mobile devices , where space is limited and quick recognition of records is important .
available in : all editions except database.com in the full salesforce site , compact layouts determine which fields appear in the chatter feed item that appears after a user creates a record with a publisher action .
in salesforce1 , compact layouts determine the fields that show up in : • an object ’s record highlights area •
an object ’s record preview cards ( but not the preview cards shown in search results ) • enhanced lookup cards on a record ’s related information page note :  compact layouts are n't available for the salesforce classic , chatter mobile for blackberry , or dashboards for ipad mobile apps .
if you do n’t create custom compact layouts , records display using a read - only , predefined system default compact layout .
once you create custom compact layouts , you can set one as the primary compact layout for the object .
if you have record types associated with an object , you can override the primary compact layout assignment and assign specific compact layouts to different record types .
compact layouts support all field types except : text area long text area rich text area • •

notes on compact layouts available in : all editions except database.com •
each record type can have only one compact layout assigned to it .
however , a compact layout can be associated with multiple record types . •
users who do n’t have access to certain fields in salesforce wo n’t see them on the compact layout . •
a compact layout must contain at least one field . •
a compact layout can only contain fields from its object .
this can include a formula field that is a cross - object reference to another object . •
removing a field from a page layout does n’t remove it from the object ’s compact layout .
the two layout types are independent .
if you change a field on a compact layout to an unsupported type , the field is removed from the compact layout . • •
before you can delete a compact layout that ’s set as the primary compact layout for the object , you must choose another • compact layout to replace it .
in salesforce1 , tasks automatically show whether a task is open or closed and the due date ( depending on a user ’s access to activity dates ) .
when customizing a task compact layout , you do n’t need to add these fields to the selected fields list .
search layouts in salesforce1 the salesforce1 app uses your organization ’s search results search layouts to determine the fields that display in search results .
search layouts allow up to 10 fields , but salesforce1 search results show only the first four fields from an object ’s search results layout .
you may want to re - order the fields in some or all of your organization ’s search results layouts so that the most important data is visible for mobile users .
in the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios devices , each recent record listed on a record search page shows the record ’s name and the value of the second field in that object ’s search results layout .
as a user types a search term in the record search box , the recent record list is filtered based on matching in the second field on the layout , as well as the name field .
this allows users to see records associated with a different object or data value , not just those with simple name matching .
for example , if account name is the second field in the search layout for the contact object , typing acme in the search box on the contact search page shows recently - accessed contacts that are related to the acme account .
when you execute the search , however , the search results page shows records that match against any of the searchable fields for the object .
publisher actions in the salesforce1 app the publisher actions feature lets you create actions and add them to the publisher , which displays in salesforce1 on feeds and record views .
you can customize the order in which standard chatter actions , including post , link , and poll , appear in the publisher .
you can also use action layouts to specify the fields that are included in each action , and in which order .
there are four general types of actions : • create actions let users create records .
70 mobile set up your organization to use the salesforce1 app • log - a - call actions let users record the details of phone calls or other customer interactions .
• update actions let users make changes to a record from the record ’s feed . • custom actions are visualforce pages or canvas apps that users can access directly in the publisher .
for create , log - a - call , and custom actions , you can create either object - specific or global actions .
update actions must be object - specific .
see new publisher actions for creating chatter groups and adding group members , and publisher actions overview in the salesforce help for more information .
the publisher actions that are initially available in salesforce1 depend on the age of your organization — see default actions overview and mobile smart actions overview in the salesforce help .
you can also create unique global or object - specific publisher actions that are tailored to your business needs — see setting up publisher actions in the salesforce help .
note :  if you want to assign a custom icon to a publisher action , the optimal icon size for display in the salesforce1 publisher is 120 x 120 pixels .
for best results , do n’t use an icon larger than this . customize the salesforce1 navigation menu customize your mobile salesforce experience by selecting apps , standard menu items , visualforce pages , or flexible pages to display in the salesforce1 navigation menu .

if your community includes the chatter tab , you ’ll see salesforce1 navigation menu items for feeds , people , and groups . •
when accessing a community , the navigation menu shows only tabs that are included in that community . •
there is no all company feed . •
• external users accessing communities do n’t see a help link . •
site.com branding is not supported .
search is scoped by community and returns only items from the current community .
the only exception is records , since they are shared across communities . •
a user ’s list of notifications includes notifications from all communities the user is a member of .
the name of the community in which the notification originated appears after the time stamp . •
the url for an external user accessing salesforce1 is slightly different .
for instance , if your domain is universaltelco.force.com and your community prefix is customer , the url to access the community in salesforce1 is universaltelco.force.com/customer/one/one.app .
differences in finding information if you ’re new to salesforce and do n’t yet have a history of recent items , you initially see these objects in the recent section of the navigation menu : • accounts • cases • contacts • files ( if you ’re using one of the downloadable apps and chatter is enabled ) • groups ( unless added directly to the navigation menu ) • leads • opportunities • people ( unless added directly to the navigation menu ) as you spend more time in salesforce and the salesforce1 app , the objects that you use the most will display in the recent section instead .
to be available in salesforce1—in the navigation menu , in the list of recently accessed records that appears when you begin a search , or in search results — an object must be included in a standard or custom salesforce app .
this is true for the supported standard objects and your organization ’s custom objects .

you ca n’t accept or decline an event you ’ve been invited to . •
invitee related lists display slightly different content from the full salesforce site .
in the full site , the invitee list includes the event owner and related contacts and leads who are n’t also invitees .
in salesforce1 , the invitee related list includes invitees only .
the following queries let you reproduce the full site functionality in salesforce1 .
to allow the event organizer to see all the invitees if your organization uses shared activities , use this query : select relationid from eventrelation where isinvitee = true and eventid='[event_id ] ' where event_id is the child event ’s id .
to allow the event organizer to see all the invitees if your organization does n’t use shared activities , use this query : select relationid from eventrelation where eventid='[event_id ] '
these queries get the main event ’s relations and display them for the given child event .
you can add a where clause to further filter the results . •
each event in a related list shows : icon , identifying the item as an event ◊ the ◊ subject ◊ location ◊ start date and time ◊ end date and time ◊ up to three more fields , depending on your organization ’s settings tasks • archived tasks are n’t supported , and you ca n’t use shared activities to relate multiple contacts to a task . •
new , edited , and deleted tasks do n’t appear in a task list until you refresh the list .
when you close a task by tapping the icon , the task is shown crossed out until you refresh the list .
in task lists , the sorting of priority tasks is determined by the order of the fields in the priority picklist . • •
the more tasks you view , and the more relationships tasks have to other records , the longer it may take to view tasks or use other features in the salesforce1 app . •
when more than 1,000 overdue tasks exist , task lists in salesforce1 do n’t display any tasks at all .
use the full site to view your overdue tasks and close them , postpone them , or delete their due dates .
• task layouts contain a few unique elements that make tasks easier to work with .
these elements do n’t appear in a compact layout because you ca n’t change them , but users always see them : icons represent the status of the isclosed field to users with the edit task permission .
and icon represents a task marked high priority ( including custom high priority ) .
◊
the ◊ the ◊ all tasks show the subject .
◊ all tasks show the due date , if it exists and a user has permission to view it .
◊ tasks include the primary contact and the account or other record , if they exist .
the fields in each list may vary , depending on your organization ’s settings .
82 mobile salesforce1 differences from the full salesforce site you control the layout of task records and tasks in the task list using the new compact layout feature .
you control related lists , as always , using the page layout editor .
adding the subject or due date field to either layout does n’t change the appearance of tasks — those fields wo n’t appear twice .
below the built - in task elements , salesforce1 displays up to three additional fields .
◊ the default compact layout for tasks includes two fields : the name of a lead or contact , and an opportunity , account , or other record the task is related to .
◊ in an activities related list , a task ’s fields depend on what record you ’re viewing and how you ’ve defined the layout for that object .
for more information , see compact layout overview .
differences with approvals these approval - related options are n’t available in the salesforce1 app : submitting records for approval . •
•
recalling approval requests . • reassigning approval requests . • accessing an approval request from the record view .
instead , approvers need to tap the salesforce1 notification .
• manually selecting the next approver .
for approval requests that require this manual selection , the approver needs to log in to the full salesforce site .
in addition : • the approval history related list does n’t display comments . •
the items to approve related list is n’t available . •
salesforce1 notifications for approval requests are n’t sent to queues .
for each approval step involving a queue , we recommend adding individual users as assigned approvers , so at least those individuals can receive the approval request notifications in the mobile app .
to have both queues and individual users as assigned approvers , select automatically assign to approver(s ) instead of automatically assign to queue in the approval step .
salesforce1 notifications for approval requests are sent only to users who have access to the record being approved .
assigned approvers who do n’t have record access can still receive email approval notifications , but they wo n’t be able to complete the approval request until someone grants record access . •
notifications in the salesforce1 app •
the notifications list in the app displays the 20 most recent notifications you received within the last 90 days . •
to ensure that sensitive information is n’t distributed through a third - party service without proper authorization , push notifications include only minimal content by default .
to include full content in push notifications ( for example , a post or a comment , a chatter group ’s name , or a task description ) , go to setup in the full site , click mobile administration > notifications > settings , check include full content in push notifications , and agree to the terms and conditions on behalf of your company .
for details , see salesforce1 notifications on page 72 .
streaming api limits apply to notifications . •
using today
today is a new feature that ’s available in the salesforce1 downloadable apps for android phones and iphone and ipad devices .
it ’s not available in the salesforce1 mobile browser app , nor in the full salesforce site .
83 mobile salesforce1 differences from the full salesforce site there are some considerations when using today . •
you see local events from selected calendars on your mobile device but salesforce events are n’t available in this release . • if some or all of your calendar servers do n’t automatically push data to your device , you need to update your calendars before you can see the most current information in today . •
the 24-hour time format is n’t supported . •
when viewing a multi - day event , only the ending date and time are displayed in the highlights area . •
the wrong date and time may display for recurring multi - day events . •
if your calendar does n’t display invitee names because the list is too long , today shows a count of “ 1 invitee ” on the event card and does n’t show any invitees when you open the event .
if an event does n’t include invitees and there are n’t any notes , only the detail page displays . •
•
today supports links in the notes card on the event home page , provided they use the http:// , https:// , or www protocols .
but links are n’t active in the notes field on the event detail page . •
the meeting organizer ’s acceptance status is n’t displayed on iphone devices . •
today is unable to find a matching salesforce record for a meeting organizer of an icloud event because the icloud api does n’t return an email address . •
on android devices , a meeting organizer ’s name may not display correctly if there is n’t a matching salesforce record for the person . •
on android devices , if a meeting organizer of a microsoft exchange® event is also an invitee , the person appears in both the invitees and invitation from cards .
the person ’s acceptance status may be displayed in multiple locations and may not be accurate .
also , if there ’s a matching salesforce record for the organizer , the event page might not display correctly .
• chatter free users and chatter customers are n’t able to access today because these user license types do n’t have access to contacts or person accounts .
support for salesforce customizations • custom home pages ◊ salesforce1 does n’t support login redirection to salesforce apps or custom home tabs like the full salesforce site does .
if you prefer to retain this redirection for users who log in to salesforce from a mobile browser , turn off the salesforce1 mobile browser app .
this can be done on a user - by - user basis or for your entire organization .
• visualforce pages ◊ standard tabs , custom object tabs , and list views that are overridden with a visualforce page are n’t supported in salesforce1 .
the visualforce page is shown for full site users but salesforce1 users will see the default salesforce1 page for the object instead .
this restriction exists to maintain the salesforce1 experience for objects .
◊ embedded visualforce pages — that is , those added to a page layout — that contain an < apex : enhancedlist > component may cause the salesforce1 app to crash when used on ios devices .
◊ when viewing visualforce pages on an android device , horizontal scrolling does n’t work if the page is wider than the viewport .
redesign the page so that it ’s narrower than the viewport .
• flexible pages ◊ you ca n’t add more than 25 components to a flexible page .
◊ the recent items component does n’t support standard objects .
◊ flexible pages are n’t supported for salesforce communities .

visualforce you can use visualforce to extend the salesforce1 app , letting users access your visualforce pages from the navigation menu , the publisher , or record detail or related information pages .
when developing visualforce pages for the salesforce1 app , consider how they ’ll look and behave on a mobile device .
also note that you can develop your visualforce pages to work with both salesforce1 and standard salesforce .
you ’ll need to indicate that a visualforce page is mobile - ready and can be used in the salesforce1 app by enabling the available for salesforce mobile apps checkbox in your visualforce page settings under develop > pages .
there are several updates in the winter ’14 and spring ’14 releases that make development with visualforce easier , including improvements for html5 and javascript development .
you 'll want to consider these changes when developing mixed html and visualforce pages for salesforce1 .
you ’ll also want to utilize html5 pass - through attributes on your visualforce components to enable html5 features , such as client - side validation .
see the visualforce guidelines and best practices section of the salesforce1 app developer guide .
the sforce.one javascript utility object is automatically added to all visualforce pages when run inside the salesforce1 container .
this object is used to manage programmatic navigation in salesforce1 .
see managing navigation in the salesforce1 app developer guide .
force.com
canvas force.com canvas lets you easily integrate a third - party web application in the salesforce1 app .
in spring ’14 , you can make your force.com canvas apps available from the salesforce1 navigation menu .
you can also expose canvas apps in salesforce1 as publisher actions in the publisher or as items in a feed .
see canvas apps accessible from the salesforce1 navigation menu , and integrating your web applications in salesforce1 with force.com canvas in the salesforce1 app developer guide for more details .
force.com canvas supports streaming api notifications , which you can use in your canvas app exposed in salesforce1 .

publisher actions actions appear in the publisher in the salesforce1 app , and are a quick way for mobile users to access commonly used tasks or functionality .
you can create custom actions using visualforce or force.com canvas .
85 mobile develop for the salesforce1 app overview custom actions are n’t specific to mobile users , and can appear in both the salesforce1 app and in the full salesforce site .
in the salesforce1 app , custom actions appear in the publisher .
in the full salesforce site , custom actions appear in the publisher menu .
note :  if you want to assign a custom icon to a publisher action , the optimal icon size for display in the salesforce1 publisher is 120 x 120 pixels .
for best results , do n’t use an icon larger than this .
custom actions automatically get their own rest api endpoints of the form /services / data / api version / sobjects / object name / quickactions / custom action name .
for example , a custom create_delivery action created for the invoice__c object would get an endpoint that looks like : /services / data / v29.0/sobjects / invoice__c / quickactions / create_delivery .
see calling actions from the api in salesforce1 app developer guide .
flexible pages you can use flexible pages to create custom app home pages in salesforce1 .

◊ ip relaxation refers to the ip restrictions that the users of the connected app are subject to .
an administrator can choose to either enforce or bypass these restrictions by choosing one of the following options .
- - enforce ip restrictions : default .
a user running this app is subject to the organization ’s ip restrictions , such as ip ranges set in the user ’s profile .
relax ip restrictions with second factor : a user running this app bypasses the organization ’s ip restrictions if either of these conditions are true : - the app has ip ranges whitelisted and is using the web server oauth authentication flow .
only requests coming from the whitelisted ips are allowed .

◊ refresh token policy specifies the validity period for a refresh token .
refresh tokens are used by the connected app to obtain new sessions without requiring the user to provide their credentials .
the connected app simply exchanges the refresh token for a new session .
using refresh token policies , administrators control how long a refresh token may be used .
options include the following . - - - - refresh token is valid until revoked .
this is the default behavior , and specifies that the token may be used indefinitely , unless revoked by the user or administrator .
revoke tokens in a user ’s detail page under oauth connected apps , or in the oauth connected apps usage report .
immediately expire refresh token .
this setting specifies the token is immediately invalid .
the user may use the current session ( access token ) already issued , but can not use the refresh token to obtain any new sessions . expire refresh token
if not used for n. this setting invalidates the token if it is not used for the amount of time specified .
for example , if the field value states 7 days , and the refresh token is not exchanged for a new session within seven days , the next attempt to use the token fails .
the token expired and can no longer generate new sessions .
if the refresh token is successfully used before 7 days , monitoring the period of inactivity resets , and the token is valid for another 7 days .
expire refresh token after n. this setting invalidates the refresh token after a fixed amount of time .
for example , if the policy states 1 day , the refresh token may be used to obtain new sessions for 24 hours .
after 24 hours , the token can not be used to obtain new sessions .
the refresh token policy is only evaluated during usage of the issued refresh token , and does not directly impact a users current session .
a user 's session may be maintained by usage , and it 's validity period is defined in setup , security controls > session settings .
refresh tokens are only required when a user 's session has expired or is no longer available .
for example , if you set a refresh token policy to expire refresh token after 1 hour , and the user uses the application for two hours , they will not be forced to authenticate after one hour .
they will only be required to re - authenticate when the session has expired and the client attempts to exchange its refresh tokens for a new session .

allowable values are none ( no locking ) , 1 , 5 , 10 , and 30 minutes .
this policy is only enforced if a corresponding pin length is configured .
enforcement of the policy is the responsibility of the connected app .
apps written using the salesforce mobilesdk can automatically enforce this policy , or the app may read the policy from the userinfo service and enforce the policy itself .

chatter profile - based rollout —
pilot roll out chatter for a subset of users instead of all users in your organization .
up to now , enabling chatter meant giving all users in your organization full access to chatter .
starting with this release , salesforce introduces chatter profile - based rollout .
use this new feature to make chatter available for a part of your organization , but not for all users .
once chatter profile - based rollout is enabled for your organization , your administrator can turn on chatter for only the users that have been assigned the required user profile or permission sets .
all other users in your organization wo n’t have access to chatter .
with chatter profile - based rollout , larger organizations can plan a controlled rollout and deploy chatter in a way that enhances adoption and engagement on a team - by - team basis .
organizations with regulatory constraints have the option to give full or no access to chatter based on employee roles and profiles .
for example , if you assign a user profile or permission set that excludes chatter access to a subset of users , these users still have access to salesforce objects , like accounts , leads , opportunities and so on , but they do n’t see the record feed and they ca n’t make posts .
chatter profile - based rollout is available through a pilot program .
the pilot program is open for customers who currently do n’t have chatter enabled in their organization .
for more information about chatter profile - based rollout , contact your salesforce representative .

your sales managers may already be using revenue splits for crediting team members who are directly responsible for opportunities .
to provide more flexibility with how they assign credit for opportunities , we ’ve added overlay splits , which help sales managers and other team members allocate credit to overlay sales roles for working on opportunities .

for example , a sales team may include sales engineers , product specialists , or partners who help close deals , but are not directly responsible for them .
overlay forecasts let sales managers predict revenue from overlay splits .
forecast amounts roll up through the role hierarchy based on the opportunity ’s amount field and the overlay team member ’s split percentage .

adding experience if a user selects more records to add than their record balance , we ’ll let them know .
they can then proceed to add as many records as their balance and other settings allow without having to adjust their selection .
when users add object records , duplicates of records your organization already owns ( ) are included if your organization allows duplicates for that object . or
example : the user has a record balance of 133 , but selects 200 contact records to add .
your organization allows duplicates for contacts , and 50 of the selected contacts are duplicates of contact records your organization already owns .
we ’ll add all of the 50 duplicate contacts ( adding duplicates does not affect the record balance ) , plus 133 of the remaining new contacts , and the user ’s record balance will be 0 .
enhanced exporting experience if a user selects more records to export than their record balance , we ’ll let them know .
they can then proceed to export as many records as their balance allows without having to adjust their selection .
when exporting records , the user can opt to either : include already purchased records ( • • exclude all selected records that the organization already owns ( ) along with new records ; or or ) and export only new records .
example : the user has a record balance of 50 , but selects 150 account records to export .
she opts to export both new and already purchased records .
thirty ( 30 ) of the selected records have already been purchased by your organization .
we ’ll export all of the 30 previously purchased records , plus 50 of the remaining new records .
after the export , the user ’s record balance will be 0 .

milestonetriggertimecalculator apex interface with a custom apex class .
with this interface , you can reduce the number of entitlement processes your agents have to work with .
with this interface , salesforce calculates the trigger time for a milestone based on variables in a case .
for example , you might want to use dynamically calculated trigger times , or “
time to complete , ” for milestones in order to generate different milestone trigger times for different case priority levels .
this apex interface provides the flexibility to use nearly any aspect of a case to influence the trigger time .
dynamically calculated milestone trigger times also allow you to simplify your entitlement management .
instead of creating hundreds of entitlement processes that map to differing conditions on a case , you can use one entitlement process with the support .

and your support agents wo n’t have to search through hundreds of entitlement processes when a new case comes in .

apply business hours to milestones and entitlement processes model more complex slas with business hours on milestones and entitlement processes .
applying business hours to an entitlement process lets you use the same entitlement process for cases with different business hours , and applying them to a milestone allows the business hours to change with the severity of a case .
you can specify the business hours at which your customer support team operates and then apply those business hours to cases , entitlement processes , and milestones .
applying business hours to an entitlement process lets you use the same one for cases with different business hours .
for example , if you set the business hours on an entitlement process to weekdays from 9 to 5 and a customer requests evening and weekend updates to the case , you can then create an update customer milestone with its own 24x7 business hours .
applying business hours to a milestone also allows business hours to change with the severity of a case .
for example , a " last touch " milestone can change its business hours with a change in severity level , while the other milestones in the entitlement process , such as an initial contact milestone , remain unchanged .
if the severity of the case goes up , the customer needs to be contacted more frequently , but the initial contact milestone would have already passed and would not need a business hours adjustment .
business hours applied to a milestone override those applied to an entitlement process , which override those applied to a case .
if no business hours are set on the milestone , then the ones for the entitlement process are used .
if neither are set , then the hours on the case are used .

generally available route incoming chat requests that originate from a particular chat button directly to a specific agent using the deployment api and pre - chat forms .
by editing a few parameters in live agent ’s deployment api , you can route all chats that originate from a specific button to a single agent with specialized skills .
direct - to - agent routing helps you connect customers to the person who can answer their questions right the first time . 167 service chat routing enhancements for example , if only one of your company ’s agents is an expert on a specialized product that you sell , you can associate that agent with a chat button that appears on that product ’s web page .
instead of routing chats from that button to a pool of customer service agents who may or may not specialize in that subject matter , direct - to - agent routing lets you connect customers to the agent in your company who can help them most .
if that agent is n’t available , you can configure rules that allow the chat to be rerouted to other agents .
use the following deployment api methods to set up direct - to - agent routing .

chat routing enhancements use enhanced chat routing to improve the way incoming chat requests are routed to agents .
as more customers move to online platforms to seek help for their questions and problems , companies are seeking more efficient ways to route incoming chat requests to the right agents .
in spring ’14 , we ’ve added some new options to help you route chat requests to agents quickly and efficiently .
reroute declined chat requests to available agents you now have the option to reroute chat requests that have been declined by all agents back to agents who are still available .
previously , if all agents declined a chat request , the chat would automatically be canceled .
as a result , customers whose chats were canceled were n’t getting the help they needed .
now , chats that have been declined by all agents can be sent to these agents again for the number of iterations you specify .
this functionality is available for both chat buttons and automated invitations .
to enable this option , in setup , click customize > live agent > chat buttons & automated invitations .
automatically accept chats after they ’re
assigned to an agent you now have the option of having chats be automatically accepted after they ’re assigned to an agent .
previously , agents had to manually accept a chat that was assigned to them from the list of incoming chats .
however , if the agent was n’t able to accept the chat in a timely manner , the customer might have to wait for the agent to accept the chat for an indefinite amount of time .
now , you can specify that these chats are automatically accepted after they are assigned , opening the chat in a new tab for the agent in the salesforce console .
this functionality is available for both chat buttons and automated invitations .
to enable this option , in setup , click customize > live agent > chat buttons & automated invitations .
transfer files during a chat —

note :  file transfer in live agent is available as a pilot feature in spring ’14 .
to enable this feature for your organization , contact your salesforce.com representative .
agents associate incoming files with new or existing records .
for example , if a customer is receiving an error when they try to complete a process , they can upload and transfer a screenshot of the error message to the agent , which the agent could attach to an existing case to provide more context for the customer ’s issue . 168 service supervisor tab available in salesforce console supervisor tab available in salesforce console
add the supervisor tab to the salesforce console to give your live agent supervisors easy access to information about their agents’ activities without disrupting supervisors’ workflow .
previously , supervisors could n’t view the supervisor tab in the salesforce console ; instead , they could only access information about their agents’ activities from the live agent supervisor panel , located in a different part of the application .
this caused supervisors to have to switch back and forth between the salesforce console and the supervisor panel to do their work .
now you can add the supervisor tab to your organization ’s salesforce console to allow supervisors to access agents’ information without interrupting their workflow . 1 .

all the capabilities of the analytics rest api are also available in the apex api .

charts that you add to page layouts are automatically visible in the salesforce1 app .
analytics api available in apex use the analytics api via apex for faster performance and easier maintenance .
all the capabilities of the analytics rest api are also available in the apex api .
the analytics rest api , introduced in winter ’14 , gives developers access to many reporting and charting features that were previously available only through the web interface .
if your customization strategy rests on apex coding rather than the rest api , you can now use apex to make all the same calls you can make with the rest api .
for example , here ’s a way you could use apex to automate a reporting workflow .
this apex code takes a report id and message as input , runs the specified report , and posts a chatter message to every user or entity listed as a grouping .
global class reporttochattercontroller { 185 analytics embed report charts in visualforce pages @remoteaction global static boolean posttochatter(string reportid , string message ) { reports .
reportresults res = reports .
reportmanager.runreport(reportid ) ; feeditem [ ] posts = new feeditem[res.getgroupingsdown().getgroupings().size ( ) ] ; for(integer i=0;i < posts.size();i++ ) { feeditem post = new feeditem ( ) ; post .
parentid = ( id)res.getgroupingsdown().getgroupings()[i].getvalue ( ) ; post .
body = message + res.getreportmetadata().getname ( ) + ' ( ' + res.getgroupingsdown().getgroupings()[i].getlabel ( ) + ' : ' + res.getfactmap().get(''+i+'!t').getaggregates()[0].getlabel()+ ' ) ' ; posts[i ] = post ; } insert posts ; return true ; } } note :  synchronous and asynchronous report runs via the api are subject to different limits .
synchronous : 500 per hour . •
• asynchronous : 1200 per hour .
in either case , calls to the analytics apex api and to the analytics rest api count toward the same limits pool .
embed report charts in visualforce pages define charts using the report builder and reuse them in any visualforce page , often with only a single line of code .
charts can include dynamic filters , auto - refresh based on expiration time , and many other options .
with this enhancement , all of your most critical charts and analytics are in context , wherever you are working .
you no longer need workarounds such as iframes or javascript to create a visualforce page with dashboard - like functionality .
you can just pull the chart into your visualforce component by its report id .
for example , here ’s how you might bring in a report with the id 00oxxxxxxxxxxxx .
< apex : page > < analytics : reportchart reportid=”00oxxxxxxxxxxxx”></analytics : reportchart > < /apex : page > and here ’s the resulting embedded report : 186 analytics embed charts in salesforce1 for details , see the visualforce developer guide .

flexible sorting in reports flexible sorting in reports in a report with multiple grouping levels , sort groupings by the summary value that defines each grouping .
available in : all editions except database.com user permissions needed to sort report results : “ run reports ”
for example , you ’ve grouped an opportunities report by type of business , in order to highlight the most promising deals .
each type grouping is in turn grouped by stage , and each stage grouping is grouped by lead source .
now you can sort the type grouping by amount , the stage grouping by stage , and the lead source grouping by record count .
this includes both standard summary values and values that are generated by a custom summary formula .
figure 3 : each grouping level can be sorted independently .
hide unused report types if your users only use a subset of the available standard report types , show only those report types , and hide the ones they do n’t need .
available in : all editions except database.com user permissions needed to hide report types : “ manage custom reports ” hidden report types do n’t show up when you use the search box on the create new report page .
if you hide all the report types in a folder , the folder is hidden too .
on the reports tab , click new report , then select select report types to hide .
the green check mark next to a report means it ’s visible to everyone .
click the check mark to change it to an x and hide that report type .

dashboards we ’ve made it easier to filter dashboards , edit someone else ’s dashboard , and display percentage amounts in table components .
named dashboard filter values reduce screen clutter by assigning a nickname to a group of values you ’ve identified as one filter selection , then save and reuse those values .
by providing different named views of a single dashboard , you multiply the dashboard ’s utility without having to edit the underlying reports or dashboard components . 192 analytics named dashboard filter values editing dashboards without “ view
all data ”
when enhanced folder sharing is enabled , a user who is not the running user of a dashboard can make certain changes to the dashboard without seeing data as seen by the running user .
percentages in table components when a column in a table component contains amounts that are expressed as fractions , you can display the fractions as percentages .
named dashboard filter values reduce screen clutter by assigning a nickname to a group of values you ’ve identified as one filter selection , then save and reuse those values .
by providing different named views of a single dashboard , you multiply the dashboard ’s utility without having to edit the underlying reports or dashboard components .
available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions
for example , on a sales dashboard , you might gather several stages of opportunities into groups called “
early , ” “ under way , ” and “ advanced .
” when each of those categories is the nickname of a specific set of filter values , users can quickly switch their view of the dashboard to show only data relevant to deals that are in the stage they ’re interested in .
figure 10 : named dashboard filter values help users get the right information quickly .
editing dashboards without “ view
all data ”
when enhanced folder sharing is enabled , a user who is not the running user of a dashboard can make certain changes to the dashboard without seeing data as seen by the running user .
available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions to edit dashboards when you 're not the running user : “ run reports , ” “ create and customize dashboards , ” and
editor access to the dashboard folder user permissions needed 193 analytics percentages in table components users can now edit dashboard components and save the changes as the current running user of the dashboard , even if they are not the running user .
this capability is enabled by default when enhanced folder sharing is on .
( see turn on enhanced folder sharing ) .
this capability only extends to modifying the metadata ( such as titles , thresholds , footers , or headers ) .
it does not include changing chart types and reports , because that could expose data the editing user does not otherwise have access to .
until now , you needed the “
view all data ” permission to edit a dashboard if you were not the running user yourself , even if you had editor access to the dashboard .
this is because editing a dashboard could expose data to the person editing the dashboard that was meant to be seen by the running user .
for example , say an analyst wanted to change a threshold in a gauge component on a dashboard designed for an executive , and the executive , who has greater viewing access , was the running user of the dashboard .
without the “
view all data ” permission , the analyst might not have been able to see the data she needed to see in order to make the required changes .
the analyst was allowed to edit the dashboard only if the running user was below her in the role hierarchy , and she had the “ view my team 's dashboards ” permission .
percentages in table components when a column in a table component contains amounts that are expressed as fractions , you can display the fractions as percentages .
for example , customer satisfaction scores may be recorded as fractions of 1 , with 1 being a perfect score .
you can now express a score of .6 as 60 percent .
tip :  do n’t do this with amounts that are not in the form of fractions of 1 .
the results may not make sense .
194 analytics history tracking for cases
history tracking for cases monitor activity across cases and identify your case status changes in the last three months of a case ’s life cycle .

available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions to create , edit , and delete reports : “ create and customize reports ”
user permissions needed and “ report builder ”
for example , one way to optimize contact center operations is to watch the status field over time , watching for cases that move backward to a previous status .
this can help reveal ways to resolve cases more effectively .
for another example , try analyzing historical values of the priority field to identify cases that may have been incorrectly classified when they were opened .
watching for frequent changes in priority may also lead to ways to improve the handling of complex cases .

note : when working in site.com studio , you ’re always working on an unpublished version of your site .
it ’s your working copy .
when you restore a version , you overwrite your working copy , not your live site .
you must publish the restored version before you see the change on your live site . branding sites
branding provides a flexible way for you to define different aspects of your website ’s brand .
once branding properties are defined , your editors can easily customize everything in one centralized place , the branding editor .
when your website editors customize the properties , they get a preview of their branding changes immediately .
by adding branding properties to your website or widgets , you can easily define and change those aspects of your website ’s brand without needing to edit your cascading style sheet .
here are examples of aspects that you might define that are related to your website ’s brand : • the website ’s background , page , or link colors • font size and color •
the logo or header background image •
the thickness and color of lines to use branding in your website , you must : 197 site.com site custom properties 1 .
define the parts of your site that make up your brand by creating a branding property for each aspect such as background color , logo , and fonts .
you complete this task from branding properties within site configuration .
2 .
use expression language syntax to replace the current definitions for these properties within your cascading style sheets with the new branding properties .
3 .
use the branding editor to customize the properties and preview how your website will look .
the branding properties can also be accessed by using expression language syntax directly from within a custom code block or content block .
site custom properties in winter ’14 , we introduced custom properties for widgets , so now in spring ’14 , we ’re making custom properties available at the site level also .
site custom properties let you save time by defining commonly used values and reusing them throughout your site .
available for purchase in : enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions available ( with limitations ) in : developer edition we ’ve added a new custom properties view ( 1 ) to the site configuration section of the overview tab .
in the custom properties view , you can create custom properties and group them into sections ( 2 ) .
after you create a new property and specify its value and type , you can access the property in custom code or content blocks using expressions .
expressions serve as placeholders for data that will be replaced with information when the page loads .
to reference a site custom property in custom code or a content block , use the syntax { !
site.expression_name}.
so for example , you could create a custom property to store the company phone number with phonenumber as the expression name .
198 site.com widget enhancements in a content block , you could enter contact us at { !
site .
phonenumber}.
then , when the page loads , it would replace the value represented by { !
site .
phonenumber } to display “ contact us at 1 - 800 - 667 - 6389 ” on the page . because expressions are just placeholders , if you update the value of a property in the custom properties view , the value is updated automatically wherever the custom property is referenced on a page .
widget enhancements we ’ve improved the way you create custom widget properties .
additionally , everyone on your team can now take advantage of the widgets you build , whether they ’re site administrators , designers , or contributors .
available for purchase in : enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions available ( with limitations ) in : developer edition custom widget properties give you flexibility over how your widgets are reused , so for spring ’14 we ’ve added custom property types to let you create widgets that are even more versatile .
we ’ve also updated the way you add custom widget properties .
now when you create a new widget , you add custom properties to the widget by clicking edit custom properties in the properties pane .
this opens a new custom properties dialog where you can create properties and group them into sections .
additionally , you can let contributors add a widget to site pages by selecting available to contributors in the properties pane or in the widgets view on the overview tab .
this setting controls whether the widget appears in the contributor ’s page elements pane .
199 site.com custom property types note :  you must ensure the site page is based on a page template that has at least one editable panel .
otherwise , contributors ca n’t add widgets to the page .
but that ’s not all !
to let contributors update the widget ’s appearance using the new branding editor , you can add branding properties to the widget by clicking edit branding properties in the properties pane .
custom property types
as part of the spring ’14 widget improvements and the new site custom properties and branding features , we ’ve added several new custom property types .
available for purchase in : enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions available ( with limitations ) in : developer edition the new property types are available when designers or site administrators create site branding properties , site custom properties , widget branding properties , and widget custom properties .
property type text checkbox color image html units picklist description lets users enter a text value .
lets users set a true ( selected ) or false ( deselected ) value .
lets users specify a color , either by selecting one from the color picker or by entering a hexadecimal value , such as # 333333 .
lets users specify an image , either by browsing to a site image , uploading a new image , or entering the url to an image
. lets users enter an html value .
lets users enter a measurement , such as pixels , percentage , or em — for example , 5px .
lets users select a value from a list you define .
to add items to the picklist , create a comma - delimited list of options , where each option has a label and a value — for example , label 1:value 1 , label 2:value 2 .
if you do n’t add a value for an option , the label is used as the value by default .
to define a default picklist selection , use the format label : value : default — for example , small : s : default , large : l. font lets users select a font .
page data connections page data connections make it easy for site administrators and designers to create a detail page for a single record when working with salesforce objects .
available for purchase in : enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions available ( with limitations ) in : developer edition 200 site.com enhancements to the contributor ’s site.com studio view when combined with repeater elements , custom code , or content blocks , page data connections let you connect to standard and custom objects , retrieve a specific record , and dynamically display the record on a site page .
and when you update data in an object , the changes are reflected automatically on the live site — no site updates required .
when the page is open , you can create a page data connection by clicking edit connection in the page data connection section of the properties pane .
for example , let ’s say you want to list all of your company ’s accounts on a site page called accounts .
when a user clicks a view details link , you want to open a site page called account detail to display information for the selected account .
in this case , you could add a data repeater to the accounts site page to retrieve a list of records from the account object ( 1 ) .
using a data element , you could create a view details link ( 2 ) that , when clicked , uses a url query string to pass the account id field as a unique identifier to the account detail page .
as the account details page loads , the page data connection uses the unique identifier value to dynamically return only that record ’s details ( 3 ) .
with page data connections , you can use expressions to access the returned data anywhere on the page , including the page ’s properties .
for example , let ’s say you want to use the account name as the title of the account detail page .
in this case , you would simply enter { !
name } in the title field on the properties pane .
when the page loads , it retrieves the account name for that particular record and displays it in the browser ’s title bar .

clickjack protection clickjacking is a type of attack that tries to trick a user into clicking something , maybe a button or link , because they perceive they are clicking something safe .
instead , the button or link performs malicious actions on your site leading to data intrusion , unauthorized emails , changed credentials , or other site - specific actions .
important :  this information applies only to site.com sites .
for information about clickjack protections in salesforce , see clickjack protection enabled
by default .
hidden iframes that load your site 's pages can be placed maliciously by an unrelated page that entices the user to click a button or link that appears below the hidden iframe .
with clickjack protection , you can configure whether your browser allows frames or iframes over your site pages .
the default clickjack level for site.com is set to allow framing by the same origin only .
you can set the clickjack protection for a site to one of these levels : • allow framing by any page ( no protection ) • allow framing by the same origin only ( recommended ) • do n’t allow framing by any page ( most protection ) note :  same - origin framing allows the site ’s page to be framed only by pages on the same domain name and protocol security .
clickjack protection wo n’t be automatically enabled for sites created prior to the spring ’14 release .
to manage clickjack protection in your site : 1 .
on the overview tab , click site configuration .
204 site.com changes to the company community permission set license 2 .
click edit . 3 .
select the desired level of clickjack protection .
note : salesforce communities have two clickjack protection parts —

a trigger - ready flow is a flow that can be launched from a flow trigger workflow action .
because trigger - ready flows must be able to run in bulk and without user interaction , they ca n’t contain step , screen , or apex plug - in elements in any flow version .
note :  flow trigger workflow actions and trigger - ready flows are currently available through a pilot program .
for information on enabling this feature in your organization , contact salesforce.com .
with flow triggers , you can automate complex business processes — create flows to perform logic , and have events trigger the flows via workflow rules — without writing code .
for example , suppose you have a flow that looks up and assigns the relevant entitlement for a case . you can create a flow trigger to launch the flow whenever a case is created , so that all new cases are automatically set with a default entitlement .

lookup filter enhancements lookup filters are now supported on many more objects .
we added support for lookup filters on relationship fields that point to the following objects : campaigns , cases , contracts , ideas , leads , opportunities , products , and social personas .
we also added a related lookup filters node to all newly supported objects in setup .
note :  some standard lookup fields may not support lookup filters , even if the objects are generally supported .
212 force.com customization field sets are generally available
in addition , we ’ve enhanced the process for creating lookup filters .
validation for field type compatibility used to happen only upon saving a lookup filter .
salesforce now validates field type compatibility in real time , filtering the available field results based on the type of field that you ’ve already entered .
for example , when creating a lookup filter , if you choose a field with a date field type in the first column , then set the value / field column to field , only fields of date - compatible field types are available when you search for fields in the fourth column .
lastly , both custom fields and standard fields can now have lookup filters that are deployable through the metadata api .
field sets are generally available field sets are generally available .
a field set is a grouping of fields .
for example , you could have a field set that contains fields describing a user 's first name , middle name , last name , and business title .
when a field set is added to a visualforce page , developers can loop over its fields and render them .
if the page is added to a managed package , administrators can add , remove , or reorder fields in a field set to modify the fields presented on the visualforce page without modifying any code .
the same visualforce page can present different sets of information , depending on which fields a subscriber prefers to keep .
as an administrator , you can create or edit field sets for your organization , or edit any installed field set .
field sets are available on all standard objects that support custom fields , and any organization that supports creating visualforce pages .
text ( ) function picklist support expanded the text ( ) formula function now converts picklist values to text in approval rules , approval step rules , workflow rules , auto - response rules , escalation rules , assignment rules , and custom buttons and links .
page layout assignments for permission set licenses with the spring ’14 release , some permission set licenses provide object permissions , such as “ read ” access to cases .
to support this change , we also allow you to assign page layouts to users who received object permissions through a permission set license .
available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , developer , and database.com editions note :  while page layouts and tab settings can be assigned through profiles , when you assign users a permission set license , the related record types , user permissions , and object permissions must be assigned through a permission set .
for example : company a has several users with force.com user licenses who need access to orders .
since profiles are based on specific user licenses , these users’ profiles do n’t have the option to assign page layouts for most standard objects .
once company a is provisioned orders platform permission set licenses — which provide object permissions for orders , contracts , price books , and products to those force.com users — the organization ’s administrator can assign page layouts for those objects to force.com profiles .
users with that profile wo n’t actually see records for those objects until they are assigned the orders platform permission set license and a permission set with the appropriate object permissions .

to replenish the resource , you can purchase additional allowance .
to see your organization ’s usage - based entitlements , from setup click company profile > company information .
for example , let ’s say company a purchases 2,000 records for data.com list users with a contract ending on may 15 .
this resource has a “

use an sobject variable as a container in the flow to store , update , and reference field values for a record .
sobject variable - specific elements are available for interacting with the salesforce database : •
fast create element —
create a new salesforce record using all the fields of an sobject variable . •
fast update element — update an existing salesforce record using all the fields of an sobject variable . •
fast lookup element — use filters to look up an existing salesforce record , and query its fields to populate an sobject variable . •
fast delete element — use the id in an sobject variable to identify which record to delete in the salesforce database .
the main difference between the existing record create / lookup / update / delete elements and the new fast create / lookup / update / delete elements is how they reference values within the flow .
a record element uses regular variables and other flow resources and typically accesses one record at a time , while a fast element uses an sobject variable to access one record or an sobject collection to access multiple records .
for example , suppose that you want your flow to have the shipping address information for one or more customer accounts . • • if you want to store the shipping address information within the context of account records , use a fast lookup element .
you can choose to save the specified fields of one record in an sobject variable , or of multiple records in an sobject collection .
if you want to store the shipping address information in regular variables or other flow resources , such as screen fields , use a record lookup element .
when creating a flow , you can check whether an sobject variable contains a value before using it . •
sobject variables default to null when they ’re created .
this lets you use a decision element to make sure an sobject variable has a value before you use it , for example .
217 force.com customization collections —
pilot •
you can use them with the is null operator in decision elements and in update , delete , and lookup elements for interacting with the salesforce database . •
the new was set operator lets you use a decision element to determine whether an sobject variable field was ever set , even if set to null .
you ca n’t use was set with an sobject variable that is set to null because you ca n’t access any fields in an unassigned sobject .
there are limitations when using sobject variables in this pilot release : • flows that contain sobject variables can only be run from a from a flow trigger workflow action .
all other run methods wo n’t work , including visualforce pages , custom buttons , and the run button in the cloud flow designer .
this means that to test such a flow , you also have to : ◊ activate the flow .
◊ create a workflow rule with a flow trigger .
◊ create or update a relevant record to meet the workflow rule criteria . •
improved debugging logs on page 222 are now available to help you test your flow
. collections —
pilot you can now group together sobject values for processing as a unit .
use a variable of type sobject collection to store the values .
collections are currently available through the “
launch flows from workflow rules ” pilot program .
available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions note :  collections are currently available through the “
launch flows from workflow rules ” pilot program .
for information on enabling this feature in your organization , contact salesforce.com .
a collection is an ordered group of related items .
an individual item in a collection is similar to an sobject variable , and contains fields with values .
to see how this works , imagine looking up some account records in your organization .
you create a collection of type account to store the query results , and your query returns three records , so your collection contains three items .
the first item in the collection contains the field values from the first account record returned , the second item contains the second account record ’s values , and so on .
in addition , if your query was just for the description and phone fields of an account , each item in the collection will contain only the description and phone field values .
the values of other fields in an account sobject are not copied into the collection , with one exception : the i d field .
the i d field is always queried by default .
you can use a loop element to examine every item in the collection .
to continue the example , you could loop through the collection and check every account item in the collection to see if the phone field value is in the 415 area code and if so , perform an action .
following the previous example , let ’s use a collection named acctcollforlookup to contain the three account sobject values our lookup returned .
the items in the collection contain the description and phone field values .
we also have an account sobject variable named acctloopvar that contains the values for each account item in the collection as we loop through the collection .
using a decision element in the loop , we check each collection item to see if phone contains 415 , and set the description appropriately .
then we copy the updated acctloopvar item into a new collection named acctcollforupdate .
you ca n’t update an existing collection ; you can only add or remove items from the collection .
this is because a loop variable , like acctloopvar , is a copy of a collection item ’s values .
changing a value in acctloopvar does n’t change an item ’s value in the collection .
instead , create a new collection and add the contents of acctloopvar to that collection in the loop .
when the loop finishes we update the records from the new collection .
here ’s what the example flow looks like in the cloud flow designer . 218 force.com customization loops —
pilot collections support the contains operator in decision elements , to determine if a collection contains a specific sobject value .
the type of the sobject values in the collection must be the same as the type of the sobject value or values you ’re comparing against , and the types and values of all fields of an sobject item in the collection must match those of the sobject values you ’re comparing against for contains to evaluate to true .
the comparison operators equals and not equal can be used with collections , as can the isnull operator .
you can also use the add operator to add an sobject variable ’s field values to a new item at the end of a collection .
flows that contain collection variables can only be run from a from a flow trigger workflow action .
all other run methods wo n’t work , including visualforce pages , custom buttons , and the run button in the cloud flow designer .
this means that to test such a flow , you also have to : • activate the flow . •
create a workflow rule with a flow trigger . •
create or update a relevant record to meet the workflow rule criteria .

you can use a loop to examine every item in a collection .
a collection is a list of items that contain values from sobjects .
for example , you could loop through a collection of values from several opportunity sobject fields .
each item in the collection could include values for the accountid , amount , and closedate fields .
in a loop you can check every item in the collection to see if the amount value is greater than 10,000 and if so , use a decision element to take the correct action .
219 force.com customization datetime data types in flows a loop uses a loop variable to contain the values for each item in the collection as we loop through the collection .
in the earlier example , the loop variable would contain the opportunity accountid , amount , and closedate values at each iteration .
the loop variable must be of the same type of sobject as the collection .
for example , if your collection contains values from an account sobject , your loop variable must also be of type account .
a loop provides connectors for the next item in the collection and for where to go when there are no more items to process .
you can also control whether the loop iterates through the collection in first - to - last order , or last - to - first order .
datetime data types in flows flows now support datetime as a data type for variables .
available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions you can use a datetime variable value everywhere that a date variable value is valid .
the datetime data type is n’t available in screen input fields or choices .
the format for datetime values is mm / dd / yyyy hh : ss followed by am or pm .
in the cloud flow designer , datetime values are displayed in the time zone of the user ’s locale , not the time zone of the organization ’s locale .
automatic picklist values the cloud flow designer shows you the choices available when choosing a value for a picklist sobject field .
available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions values for picklist fields in sobjects are now automatically available when making assignments and when selecting a value to compare against .

for example , the following debug log messages show that the flow trigger passes the value 120 into the flow variable anumber .
however , the flow attempts to use that variable value to update the latitude of a geolocation field in a salesforce record . because latitude values ca n’t be greater than 90 , the flow fails and causes the flow trigger to fail .

the order of the first name and last name that you enter does n’t matter , because both versions of the name are searched .
for example , if you enter bob jo and click find , the system searches for “ bob jo ... ” and “ jo bob ... ”
the resulting list of available submitters includes names such as “ bob jones ” and “ jo bobby ” but does n’t include names such as “ bobby jones ” or “ joan bob . ”

beta address and geolocation compound fields are available in the soap and rest apis in api version 30.0 and later .
note :  this release contains a beta version of compound fields that is production quality but has known limitations
. you can provide feedback and suggestions for compound fields , especially compound address fields , on the ideaexchange .
253 force.com development geolocation compound fields compound fields group together multiple elements of primitive data types , such as numbers or strings , to represent complex data types , such as a location or an address .
compound fields are an abstraction that can simplify application code that handles the values , leading to more concise , understandable code .
compound fields are accessible as a single , structured field , or as individual component fields .
the values contained within the compound field and the values in individual fields both map to the same underlying data stored in salesforce ; they always have identical values .
code that references individual component fields is unaffected by the new compound fields .
compound fields are read - only .
changes are performed by writing to the individual component fields .
this maintains a single , consistent method for performing updates , and avoids the possibility of conflicts .
for example , if both the billingaddress compound field and billingcity individual component field were updated in the same api call , it would be unclear which value should be saved .
compound fields are available only through the soap and rest apis .
there ’s no support for using compound fields in reports , workflow , or any other part of the salesforce web app .
for the soap api , compound fields are described in both the enterprise and partner wsdls .
update your wsdl to access the new compound data types .
geolocation compound fields geolocation fields are accessible in the soap and rest apis as a structured “ compound ” data type , as well as individual latitude and longitude elements .
standard address compound fields standard addresses — addresses built into standard objects in salesforce — are accessible in the soap and rest apis as a structured “ compound ” data type , as well as individual address elements .
compound field considerations and limitations address and geolocation compound fields are convenient , and result in more concise , clear code .
however , there are a number of things you should consider when using them in your apps .
geolocation compound fields geolocation fields are accessible in the soap and rest apis as a structured “ compound ” data type , as well as individual latitude and longitude elements .
geolocation fields are created as a single field in salesforce , containing both latitude and longitude values .
when retrieving geolocation values using the soap or rest apis , prior to api 30.0 , the two values needed to be retrieved individually , as though they were two separate fields .
in api 30.0 and later , geolocation fields are available as a compound field , a structured data type that combines both values .
this improvement changes two aspects of working with geolocation fields when accessing them via the soap and rest apis . •
soql select clauses can reference geolocation fields directly , instead of separating their latitude and longitude components .
◊ api 29.0 and earlier : select location__latitude__s , location__longitude__s from warehouse__c 254 force.com development geolocation compound fields ◊ api 30.0 and later : select location__c from warehouse__c • compound geolocation field values are returned as a structured data type .
code that works with compound geolocation fields needs to reference the individual components of the returned value .
see the sample code below .
the individual components of geolocation fields continue to be available , and existing code is unaffected by this change .
note : • there are a number of considerations when working with compound geolocation fields .
see compound field considerations and limitations on page 260 . •
although geolocation fields appear as a single field in the user interface , they count as three custom fields towards your organization ’s limits : one for latitude , one for longitude , and one for internal use .
this is unchanged from prior releases .
retrieve a geolocation field using the rest api the following visualforce page uses javascript to connect to the salesforce rest api and retrieve and display the locations of nearby warehouses .
< apex : page standardcontroller="warehouse__c " > < ! -- modified from sample code published on developerforce : calling the force.com rest api from visualforce pages , revisited http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/?p=14534 -- > < apex : includescript < script > value="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com / ajax / jquery / jquery-1.7.2.min.js"/ >
jquery(document).ready(function($ ) { //
pull a few warehouse records via the rest api , // including the location__c geolocation field $ .ajax('/services / data / v30.0/query?q= ' + { ' select+name,+location__c+from+warehouse__c+limit+10 ' , beforesend : function(xhr ) { // set the oauth header from the session id xhr.setrequestheader ( ' authorization ' , ' bearer { ! $ api .
session_id } ' ) ; } , success : function(response ) { //
append each warehouse name and location to the html list $ .each(response.records , function(index , record ) { $ ( ' # warehouseslist').append ( ' < li > ' + record .
name + ' -- ( ' + // access the individual components of a geolocation // compound field using dot notation record . location__c.latitude
+ ' , ' + record . location__c.longitude + ' ) ' + ' < /li > ' ) ; } ) ;
} } , error : function(jqxhr , textstatus , errorthrown ) { //
uh oh , something went wrong ... alert(jqxhr.status + ' : ' + errorthrown ) ; 255 force.com development geolocation compound fields } } ) ; ) ; < /script
> < h1>retrieve warehouses and locations via rest api</h1 >
< p > warehouses:</p > < ul id="warehouseslist " > < /ul
>
< /apex : page > the page simply displays the locations as numeric latitude and longitude values .
this sample is deliberately simple , to make it clear how to access geolocation compound field values .
you can easily add a bit more javascript and place the warehouses on a map , using your favorite mapping service ’s javascript api .
other changes to geolocation fields geolocation fields are compound fields that combine latitude and longitude values to describe a specific point on earth .
null values are valid only if both latitude and longitude are null .
records that have invalid geolocation field values , that is , geolocations where either latitude or longitude is null , but not both , are treated as though both values are null when used in soql where distance ( ) and order by clauses .
in other words , as though the field has not been set .
when a compound geolocation field is used in a select clause , invalid geolocation values return null .
for example : select name , location__c from warehouse__c limit 5 the values returned from an api call might look something like these values .
name ferry building depot aloha warehouse big tech warehouse s h frank & company location__c null ( 37.786108,-122.430152 ) null null san francisco tech mart ( 37.77587,-122.399902 ) 256 force.com development standard address compound fields these results include three null geolocation values .
it ’s not possible to tell which values are genuinely null , and which are invalid data .
when the individual field components of that same geolocation field are used in a select clause , the saved values are returned as before .
in other words , non - null values will be returned as that value , and null values return as null .
for example : select name , location__latitude__s , location__longitude__s from warehouse__c limit 5 in this example , the results might look like these values . name ferry building depot aloha warehouse big tech warehouse s h frank & company san francisco tech mart location__latitude__s location__longitude__s null 37.786108 null 37.763662 37.77587 -122.394507 -122.430152 null null -122.399902
in these results , only one geolocation field is genuinely null .
the other two , with partial nulls , are invalid .
note :  the behavior of geolocation individual element values in soql select statements is unchanged from previous releases .
the example here is simply intended to contrast with the behavior of the new compound version of geolocation fields .
standard address compound fields standard addresses — addresses built into standard objects in salesforce — are accessible in the soap and rest apis as a structured “ compound ” data type , as well as individual address elements .
address fields have long been a part of salesforce , provided on many standard objects , such as account , contact , quote , and user .
addresses are available as individual fields on the object , consisting of : city country countrycode ( when state and country picklists are enabled ) latitude ( beta ) longitude ( beta ) postalcode state statecode ( when state and country picklists are enabled ) street • • • • • • • • • some objects provide fields for multiple addresses .
for example , account provides for four different addresses .
in this case , address field names are prefixed with the type of address , for example , billingcity , mailingstate , and so on . new compound address fields in api 30.0 and later , every standard address is available in the soap and rest apis as a compound field , a structured data type that combines all of the above fields .
the new compound standard addresses are the following .
257 force.com development standard address compound fields account .

the new compound fields are only accessible using the soap and rest apis .
see compound field considerations and limitations on page 260 for additional details of the restrictions this imposes .
retrieving compound addresses using the new compound fields can simplify code that works with addresses , especially for soql queries .
soql select clauses can reference addresses directly , instead of all of the individual component fields . • api 29.0 and earlier : select name , billingstreet , billingcity , billingstate , billingpostalcode , from account billingcountry , billinglatitude , billinglongitude • api 30.0 and later : select name , billingaddress
from account compound address field values are returned as a structured data type .
code that works with compound address fields needs to reference the individual components of the returned value .
see the code sample below .
the individual component fields of addresses , listed above , continue to be available , and existing code is unaffected by the new compound version of addresses .
retrieve a standard address compound field with the soap api the following java method uses the salesforce soap api to retrieve and display the mailing address for a list of contacts . //
modified version of code in the soap api quickstart private void querysample ( ) { 258 force.com development standard address compound fields string soqlquery = " select firstname , lastname , mailingaddress from contact " ; try { queryresult qr = connection.query(soqlquery ) ; boolean done = false ; if ( qr.getsize ( ) > 0 ) { system.out.println("\nlogged - in user can see " + qr.getrecords().length + " contact records . " ) ; while ( ! done ) { system.out.println ( " " ) ; sobject [ ] records = qr.getrecords ( ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < records.length ; + + i ) { contact con = ( contact ) records[i ] ; string fname = con.getfirstname ( ) ; string lname = con.getlastname ( ) ; //
access the compound address field mailingaddress address addr = ( address ) con.getmailingaddress ( ) ; string streetaddr = " " ; if ( null !
= addr ) streetaddr = addr.getstreet ( ) ; if ( fname = = null ) { system.out.println("contact " + ( i + 1 ) + " : " + lname + " -- " + streetaddr ) ; system.out.println("contact " + ( i + 1 ) + " : " + fname + " " + lname + " -- " + streetaddr ) ; } else { } done = true ; qr = connection.querymore(qr.getquerylocator ( ) ) ; } if ( qr.isdone ( ) ) { } else { } } else { } ce.printstacktrace ( ) ; } catch ( connectionexception ce ) { } } system.out.println("no records found . " ) ; } using compound address fields as locations compound address fields include a geolocation field , and can be used as locations in soql where and order by clauses .
for example , here ’s a soql query to retrieve the ten accounts closest to san francisco
. select i d , name , billingaddress from account where distance(billingaddress , geolocation(37.775,-122.418 ) , " mi " ) < 20 order by distance(billingaddress , geolocation(37.775,-122.418 ) , " mi " ) limit 10 note : • the geolocation component of address fields is n’t set automatically .
you need to use a geocoding service to set these values before you can use address fields as locatable values .
search the appexchange for “ geocode ” to find a number of possible solutions .
• address fields are only supported by distance ( ) in soql .
distance ( ) calculation for address fields is n’t supported in formula fields , apex , or any other calculations .
259 force.com development compound field considerations and limitations compound field considerations and limitations address and geolocation compound fields are convenient , and result in more concise , clear code .
however , there are a number of things you should consider when using them in your apps .
both address and geolocation compound fields have the following limitations . • compound fields are read - only .
use the individual field components to update field values .
• compound fields are accessible only through the soap and rest apis .
the compound versions of fields are n’t accessible anywhere in the salesforce user interface . •
compound fields ca n’t be used in apex , because there is no apex data type for compound fields .
use the individual field components to access or update field values .
• compound fields ca n’t be used in visualforce , for example , in an < apex : outputfield>. use the individual field components to access or update field values .
• compound fields are n’t searchable .
for proximity searches , use a where distance(field , geolocation(lat , long ) , " units " ) < desiredpoximity clause .
for text string matches — for example , matching a city or postal code — search the individual fields .
• compound fields ca n’t be imported or exported .
use the individual field components to load or export values .
address compound fields have the following limitations .
• compound address fields are only available for standard addresses , that is , those address fields that exist as a basic part of the standard objects included in salesforce .
you ca n’t create custom compound address fields . •
the geolocation component of address fields is n’t set automatically .
you need to use a geocoding service to set these values before you can use address fields as locatable values .
search the appexchange for “ geocode ” to find a number of possible solutions .
• address fields are only supported by distance ( ) in soql .
distance ( ) calculation for address fields is n’t supported in formula fields , apex , or any other calculations .
( distance ( ) calculation in formula fields is supported for geolocation fields . ) • address compound fields ca n’t take advantage of custom indexing on the geolocation element of the field .
if you have more than 250,000 records , be aware of the performance implications of performing where distance ( ) and order by distance ( ) operations on address fields .
you can work around this limitation by adding an extra custom geolocation field , and indexing on that field instead .

partial data sandboxes salesforce introduces a new sandbox type : partial data sandboxes sandbox user email addresses modified on refresh
starting in spring ’14 , whenever you refresh a sandbox all user email addresses are modified to use an example domain .
the salesforce message transfer agent ignores emails that end with @example.com , so no emails are sent from a sandbox .
partial data sandboxes salesforce introduces a new sandbox type : partial data sandboxes 260 force.com development sandbox user email addresses modified on refresh available in : enterprise , performance , and unlimited editions partial data sandboxes include all of your organization ’s metadata and add a selected amount of your production organization 's data that you define using a sandbox template .
a partial data sandbox is a developer sandbox plus the data you define in a sandbox template .
it includes the reports , dashboards , price books , products , apps , and customizations under setup ( including all of your metadata ) .
additionally , as defined by your sandbox template , partial data sandboxes can include your organization 's standard and custom object records , documents , and attachments up to 5 gb of data and a maximum of 10,000 records per selected object .
a partial data sandbox is smaller than a full sandbox and has a shorter refresh interval .
you can refresh a partial data sandbox every 5 days .
sandbox user email addresses modified on refresh
starting in spring ’14 , whenever you refresh a sandbox all user email addresses are modified to use an example domain .
the salesforce message transfer agent ignores emails that end with @example.com , so no emails are sent from a sandbox .
available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and database.com editions any time the sandbox is refreshed , users who want to continue receiving sandbox emails must modify their email address .
before spring ’14 , sandbox email addresses used the following format :
email@domain.com.sandboxname starting in spring ’14 , sandbox email addresses are automatically updated to use the following format : email=domain.com@example.com for example , if your email address is awheeler@universalcontainers.com.sandbox , upon refresh that email address will be : awheeler=universalcontainers.com@example.com new user interface for monitoring deployments the page for monitoring deployments has been redesigned and now provides real - time and in - depth statistics of metadata api - based deployments .

available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , developer , and database.com editions
to view metadata deployments : “ modify all data ” user permissions needed the revamped deployment status page shows real - time statistics of the currently running deployment via charts .
in addition , this page lists queued deployments waiting for execution and deployments that have completed in the last 30 days .
using this page , you can troubleshoot problems for a failed deployment by inspecting the returned errors and test failures , or you can find out about a long - running apex test , among other things .
261 force.com development new user interface for monitoring deployments to access this page , from setup , click deployment status or deploy > deployment status .
this page lists the status of deployments started only with the metadata api deploy ( ) call , which includes deployments started from force.com ide and force.com migration tool .
this page does n’t include change sets .
all deployments are categorized in separate sections depending on their status .
the following image shows deployments in various stages on the deployment status page .
in - progress and queued deployments when running a deployment , the deployment status page shows you the real - time progress of your current deployment .
this page contains charts that provide a visual representation of the overall deployment progress .
the first chart shows how many components have already been deployed out of the total and includes the number of components with errors .
for example , the following chart indicates that 302 components were processed successfully out of 450 and there were 45 components with errors .
after all components have been deployed without errors , apex tests will start executing , if required or enabled .
a second chart shows how many apex tests have run out of the total number of tests and the number of errors returned .
in addition , the chart 262 force.com development new user interface for monitoring deployments shows the name of the currently running test .
for example , in the following chart , 77 tests have completed execution out of a total of 120 , and 1 test failed .
the following information is displayed for the current deployment .
column deployment id deployed
by start time description a unique identifier used to track the deployment .
this value is returned by the metadata api deploy ( ) call .
the name of the user performing the deployment .
the date and time when the deployment actually started , not the time the request was queued .
this value is the time the deployment status is set to in progress .
if the current deployment has errors , you can view these errors before the deployment finishes by clicking view errors .
pending deployments you can initiate multiple deployments .
only one deployment can run at a time .
the other deployments will remain in the queue waiting to be executed after the current deployment finishes .
queued deployments are listed under pending deployments in the order they will be executed .
deployment validations a deployment validation is a deployment that is used only to check the validity of the deployed files and is rolled back .
a validation does n't save any deployed components or change the organization in any way .
you can determine whether a deployment is a validation only ( validate ) or an actual deployment ( deploy ) by inspecting the information for pending deployments or the status column of deployments in the failed and succeeded sections .
canceling a deployment you can cancel a deployment while it ’s in progress or in the queue by clicking cancel next to the deployment .
the deployment then has the status cancel requested until the deployment is completely canceled .
a canceled deployment is listed in the failed section .
completed deployments deployments that have finished are listed either in the failed or succeeded sections depending on their status .
deployments that have finished but failed , and deployments that were canceled are listed in the failed section .
no changes were committed to the organization for these deployments because files were missing , components had errors , tests failed , or the deployment was canceled .
deployments that have completed successfully or have partially succeeded are listed in the succeeded section .
only deployments to a non - production organization can partially succeed .
these are deployments that have the rollbackonerror field set to false in the deployment options and have errors in a subset of components .
in a partially succeeded deployment , the failed components are n’t committed and the remaining components are committed to the organization .
to get more details about a deployment , click details next to a deployment .
use the information on the deployment details page to view the errors and troubleshoot problems for a failed or partially succeeded deployment .
the deployment details 263 force.com development change sets and deployment page includes the error messages that occurred during the deployment , errors for apex tests with stack trace information , code coverage warnings , and information about slow tests .
for a successful deployment , the deployment details page shows information about the deployment including how many components were deployed and how many apex tests were run .
deployment status the status column for completed deployments in the failed and succeeded sections lists the type and status of a deployment and has two parts : • the prefix indicates whether the deployment is a validation only ( validate : ) or an actual deployment ( deploy : ) . •
the second part of the status value contains the status of the deployment : failed or canceled for failed deployments , succeeded for succeeded deployments , or partially succeeded for partially succeeded deployments .
performance tuning resources for long - running tests if required or enabled , apex tests run as part of a deployment after all components are deployed .
apex tests that take a long time to execute delay the entire deployment .
the top five long - running tests , that is the top five tests that ran longer than two minutes , are flagged for a completed deployment in the deployment details page .
you can improve the performance of these tests to make them more efficient and speed up future deployments .
there can be many causes for slow performance .
for example , accessing organization data instead of using test data , or exercising soql queries or apex code with poor performance .
here are some resources you can use to learn about performance best practices for apex and soql .

visualforce development mode footer disabled in preview windows the visualforce development mode footer is n’t available in visualforce page preview windows launched from the developer console .
removing the development mode footer from visualforce page preview windows allows the page to render exactly the same as it does for your users .
make changes to the visualforce code in the developer console .
when you save your changes , the page automatically reloads , performing the same function as the development mode footer , with all of the extra features of the developer console .
the development mode footer , if enabled in your preferences , remains available in visualforce pages launched using the preview button in setup > develop > pages , or accessed directly by their url , for example , https://<salesforce_instance>/apex / mytestpage .
visualforce visualforce enhancements in spring ’14 are focused on improving the experience of developing apps that combine visualforce and javascript , including salesforce1 and other mobile apps , along with some additional development improvements and other changes .
available in : contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions visualforce is a framework that allows developers to build sophisticated , custom user interfaces that can be hosted natively on the force.com platform .
the visualforce framework includes a tag - based markup language , similar to html , and a set of server - side “ standard controllers ” that make basic database operations , such as queries and saves , very simple to perform .
for further information on features affected by these enhancements , refer to the visualforce developer ’s guide .

visualforce remote objects — developer preview javascript remoting is a popular , powerful , and efficient method for building web apps with visualforce , especially for creating pages for use in salesforce1 , or working with javascript libraries like jquery or angularjs .
visualforce remote objects are proxy objects that allow basic dml operations on sobjects directly from javascript .
remote objects take some of the complexity out of javascript remoting , by reducing the need for @remoteaction methods in an apex controller or extension .
like javascript remoting , remote objects calls do n’t count towards api request limits .
namespace attribute added to < apex : actionfunction > the namespace attribute lets you specify a javascript namespace to add to functions generated by the < apex : actionfunction > component .
use it to avoid javascript function name collisions , and to implement organizational coding standards .
visualforce remote objects — developer preview javascript remoting is a popular , powerful , and efficient method for building web apps with visualforce , especially for creating pages for use in salesforce1 , or working with javascript libraries like jquery or angularjs .
visualforce remote objects are proxy objects that allow basic dml operations on sobjects directly from javascript .
remote objects take some of the complexity out of javascript remoting , by reducing the need for @remoteaction methods in an apex controller or extension .
like javascript remoting , remote objects calls do n’t count towards api request limits .
note :  remote objects is currently available as a developer preview .
using visualforce remote objects consists of two parts : • access definitions , written in visualforce using the new remote objects components .
these components generate a set of javascript proxy objects that you can use in the next step .
• data access functions , written in javascript .
these functions use the proxy objects made available by the access definitions to perform create , select , update , and delete operations on your data .
your page then uses the data access functions to respond to user interaction , including form submissions or controls changes , or in response to timers , or pretty much anything you can write in javascript .
remote objects example this short example shows the two elements of using remote objects .
this visualforce page retrieves a list of 10 warehouse records and displays them on the page , in response to the user clicking the retrieve warehouses button .
< apex : page > < ! -- remote objects definition to set accessible sobjects and fields -- > < apex : remoteobjects > < apex : remoteobjectmodel name="warehouse__c " jsshorthand="warehouse " fields="name , id " > < apex : remoteobjectfield name="phone__c " jsshorthand="phone"/ > < /apex : remoteobjectmodel > < /apex : remoteobjects > 268 force.com development visualforce development < ! -- javascript to make remote objects calls -- > < script > fetchwarehouses = function ( ) { //
create a new remote object var wh = new sobjectmodel .
warehouse ( ) ; // use the remote object to query for 10 warehouse records wh.retrieve ( { limit : 10 } , function(err , records ) { if(err ) alert(err.message ) ; else { var ul = document.getelementbyid("warehouseslist " ) ; records.foreach(function(record ) { // build the text for a warehouse line item var whtext = record.get("name " ) ; whtext + = " -- " ; whtext + = record.get("phone " ) ; //
add the line item to the warehouses list var li = document.createelement("li " ) ; li.appendchild(document.createtextnode(whtext ) ) ; ul.appendchild(li ) ; } ) ; } } ) ; } ; < /script > < h1>retrieve warehouses via remote objects</h1 >
< p > warehouses:</p > < ul id="warehouseslist " > < /ul
> < button onclick="fetchwarehouses()" > retrieve warehouses</button > <
/apex : page > notice something very unusual about this page — there is no controller or controller extension .
all of the data access is handled by the remote objects components .
the first part of this example is the remote objects components that specify which objects and fields to make accessible on the page .
< apex : remoteobjects > < apex : remoteobjectmodel name="warehouse__c " jsshorthand="warehouse " fields="name , id " > < /apex : remoteobjectmodel > < apex : remoteobjectfield name="phone__c " jsshorthand="phone"/ > < /apex : remoteobjects >
these components generate javascript model classes , one per sobject in the access specification , which you use to make data access calls directly from your javascript code .
notice the use of the jsshorthand attribute , which creates a “ mapping ” between the full salesforce api name , and a simpler , shorter name to use in your javascript code .
setting jsshorthand is essential if you plan to package and distribute your code , because it eliminates the use of your organization ’s namespace in the packaged code .
using the shorthand does all the work .
the second part of this example is a javascript function that uses the models generated by the access definition components to retrieve a set of records for display on the page .
< ! -- javascript to make remote objects calls -- > < script > fetchwarehouses = function ( ) { //
create a new remote object var wh = new sobjectmodel .
warehouse ( ) ; // use the remote object to query for 10 warehouse records wh.retrieve ( { limit : 10 } , function(err , records ) { 269 force.com development visualforce development if(err ) alert(err.message ) ; else { var ul = document.getelementbyid("warehouseslist " ) ; records.foreach(function(record ) { // build the text for a warehouse line item var whtext = record.get("name " ) ; whtext + = " -- " ; whtext + = record.get("phone " ) ; //
add the line item to the warehouses list var li = document.createelement("li " ) ; li.appendchild(document.createtextnode(whtext ) ) ; ul.appendchild(li ) ; } ) ; } } ) ; } ; < /script >
the first line of the function creates a new warehouse object from the model ; notice that the call that creates it uses the jsshorthand for the sobject , instead of the full api name of the object .
this is a best practice : it decouples your javascript code from the specifics of your organization namespace , sobject and field names , and so on .
it also makes your code more succinct and clear .
the second line uses the new warehouse object , wh , to perform a query for warehouse records .
the call provides two things as arguments : a simple query specifier , and an anonymous function to handle the results .
the function itself is standard javascript ; it simply iterates over the results , and creates list items to append to the list of warehouses on the page .
finally , the page body is static html .
< h1>retrieve warehouses via remote objects</h1 >
< p > warehouses:</p > < ul id="warehouseslist " > < /ul
> < button onclick="fetchwarehouses()" > retrieve warehouses</button > the empty list serves as an element into which the results can be added .
when the page first loads , the list is empty . clicking the button fires the javascript function defined earlier , which performs the query and adds the results .
finally , compare this sample to the example at the end of geolocation compound fields on page 254 , which does approximately the same thing .
this sample uses basic javascript only , while the other uses jquery , which makes for an interesting stylistic contrast .
it ’s also worth noting that , unlike the other sample , this one is n’t subject to api call limits .
although remote objects supports only create , select , update , and delete operations , it ’s quite flexible in how it does so .
see “
using remote objects in javascript ” in the visualforce developer ’s guide for much more detail .

remote objects is subject to the following limits . •
remote objects is n’t a way to avoid salesforce service limits .
remote objects calls are n’t subject to api limits , but visualforce pages that use remote objects are subject to all standard visualforce limits . •
you can retrieve only 100 maximum rows in a single request .
to display more rows , submit additional requests by using the offset query parameter .
setting the rendered attribute to false on remote objects components disables the generation of the javascript for those remote objects .
any page functionality that depends on unrendered remote objects should also be disabled . •

these messages are now properly linked to the component generating the message , by adding an aria - describedby attribute to the source component , with the id of the corresponding < apex : message>. existing visualforce pages that use the < apex : message > component generate the new html automatically , improving their accessibility without new developer effort .
< apex : message > components should look the same when using the default salesforce styling .
even with custom styling , visual changes should be minimal or nonexistent .
in a few cases , you might need to make minor tweaks to your stylesheets if you want to preserve precise formatting .
changes to title attribute of < apex : page > the title attribute of < apex : page > lets you specify the contents of the html < title > element added to the page by visualforce .
use it to set the window or tab title for the page .
274 force.com development additional visualforce improvements
in previous releases , if the showheader attribute of < apex : page > was set to false , no < title > element would be generated , which was n’t always correct behavior .
beginning in api 30.0 , the behavior is changed to be more consistent with people ’s expectations of what should happen , and also to provide more control when working with html5 .
in pages set to api 30.0 or later , the < apex : page > title attribute generates an html < title > element inside the visualforce - generated < head > element , if there is one .
visualforce generates an html < head > element unless other attributes of < apex : page > are set in such a way that one wo n’t be generated .
finally , if either applyhtmltag or applybodytag is false , the value of the title attribute is ignored .
these tags are used to take full control of the html generated by the page , and it ’s assumed that your page contains full and complete html markup , including your desired < title > element .
the title attribute is available in and compatible with all visualforce pages .
< analytics : reportchart>—generally available use the < analytics : reportchart > component to add salesforce report charts to a visualforce page .

to enable this feature for your organization , contact your salesforce.com representative .
the file transfer component lets agents send a request to upload a file into the chat to a customer they ’re chatting with .

the usemultiline attribute specifies whether a customer chat window supports a multiple - line text input field .
without this attribute , the text input field in the customer ’s chat window wo n’t expand or allow line breaks , even if the customer ’s message exceeds one line of text .
the autoresizeelementid attribute allows you to dynamically resize the element that contains your live chat transcript when the transcript exceeds a certain length .
without this attribute , the element that contains your live chat transcript remains a fixed size regardless of the length of the live chat transcript .
276 force.com development
additional visualforce improvements note :  the usemultiline attribute must be set to true to resize elements with the autoresizeelementid attribute .
for information on using these attributes , see liveagent : clientchatinput in the visualforce developer ’s guide .
pagereference uris support anchors a pagereference is a reference to an instantiation of a page .
among other attributes , pagereferences consist of a url and a set of query parameter names and values
. you can construct pagereference objects with uris that include anchors or fragment identifiers , that is , an identifier following a hash symbol ( # ) .
for example : pagereference p = new pagereference('/home / home.jsp#logticket ' ) ;
in prior releases , anchors were n’t correctly parsed when included in the uri passed to the pagereference constructor .
for example , the above uri would be parsed as /home / home.jsp%23logticket .
you could generally work around the issue by passing only the base uri , and then using the setanchor ( ) method to add the anchor .
beginning in api 30.0 , that ’s unnecessary , and the above code functions as intended .
code that uses the above work - around continues to function ; you can update it , or leave it as is .
this change is versioned , and you must update your apex classes to api 30.0 to use the corrected functionality .
javascript remoting requests default to system mode ( without sharing )
like other apex classes , custom controllers and controller extensions run in system mode .
typically , you want a controller or controller extension to respect a user ’s organization - wide defaults , role hierarchy , and sharing rules .
you can do that by using the with sharing keywords in the class definition .
this behavior applies to standard visualforce requests and requests made using javascript remoting .
in previous releases , if a @remoteaction method was called on a class that did n’t explicitly declare with sharing or without sharing , the method ran as though the class was declared with sharing .
in other words , the default behavior was different for methods depending on whether they were invoked as part of a standard visualforce request or a javascript remoting request .
this was n’t intended behavior .
beginning with api 30.0 , requests execute consistently , regardless of how the class is declared , or how the method is invoked : • by default , without a sharing declaration , the method operates in system mode , as though the class was declared without sharing .
• methods in classes declared without sharing operate in system mode .
• methods in classes declared with sharing respect the user ’s organization - wide defaults , role hierarchy , and sharing rules .
this change is versioned .
you must update your apex classes to api 30.0 or later to access the new , correct behavior .
note :  if a controller extension extends a standard controller , the logic from the standard controller does n’t execute in system mode .
instead , it executes in user mode , in which the permissions , field - level security , and sharing rules of the current user apply .

using the with sharing or without sharing keywords ” in the force.com apex code developer 's guide .

implement the support .
milestonetriggertimecalculator interface to calculate a dynamic time trigger for a milestone based on the milestone type , the properties of the case , and case - related objects .
to implement the support . milestonetriggertimecalculator interface , you must first declare a class with the implements keyword as follows : global class employee implements support .
milestonetriggertimecalculator { the class for the support .
milestonetriggertimecalculator must implement the calculatemilestonetriggertime(string , string ) method , which must be declared as global or public .
the implementation of this method accepts the caseid and milestonetypeid string parameters and returns an integer value for the calculated milestone trigger time .
this sample class demonstrates the implementation of thesupport . milestonetriggertimecalculator interface .
in this sample , the case ’s priority and the milestone m1 determine that the time trigger is 18 minutes .
global class mymilestonetimecalculator implements support .
milestonetriggertimecalculator { global integer calculatemilestonetriggertime(string caseid , string milestonetypeid ) { case c = [ select priority from case where id=:caseid ] ; milestonetype mt = [ select name from milestonetype where id=:milestonetypeid ] ; if ( c . priority ! = null & & c .

last release ( winter ’14 ) , the script statement limit was eliminated .
because the script statement limit is no longer enforced , apex statements are no longer counted and tracked by the system starting in spring ‘ 14 .
for backward compatibility and to avoid breaking apex code that was saved in earlier versions , limits.getscriptstatements now returns a value that resembles statement usage but that is only an approximation based on cpu time usage .
the formula for computing the return value of limits.getscriptstatements uses the ratio of cpu time that is used toward your transaction ’s cpu timeout limit to provide an approximation of the former behavior .
the value is not actual statement usage , but it should prevent failure for existing uses of the method .
because apex statements are n’t counted anymore , do not use the deprecated script statement limits methods ( limits.getscriptstatements ( ) and limits.getlimitscriptstatements ( ) ) to monitor your transaction limits .
instead , call the cpu time limits methods ( limits.getcputime ( ) and limits.getlimitcputime ( ) ) . chatter in apex to create custom chatter experiences in salesforce , use chatter in apex .
many chatter rest api resource actions are exposed as static methods on apex classes in the connectapi namespace .
these methods use other connectapi classes to input and return information .
the connectapi namespace is referred to as chatter in apex .
in apex , it is possible to access some chatter data using soql queries and objects .
however , connectapi classes expose chatter data in a much simpler way .
data is localized and structured for display .
for example , instead of making many calls to access and assemble a feed , you can do it with a single call .
note :  to integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third party web applications with chatter , use chatter rest api .

new independent auto - number sequence test option a new option has been added to ensure that auto - number fields in your organization 's records do n’t have gaps due to test records created in apex tests .
this option isolates the auto - number sequence used in apex tests from the sequence used in your organization .
as a result , the creation of test data in apex tests does n't cause the sequence of auto - number fields to be higher for new non - test records in your organization .
if this option is n’t enabled , there will be gaps in the auto - number field whenever apex tests create test records with auto - number fields .
for example , if account has an auto - number field , and there are 50 account records in your organization , the field value 301 force.com development api of the last created account can be n-0050 .
after running an apex test that creates five test accounts , this causes the auto - number sequence to be increased by five even though these test records are n’t committed to the database and are rolled back .
next time you create a non - test account record , its auto - number field value will be n-0056 instead of n-0051 , hence , the gap in the sequence .
if you enable this option before running an apex test that creates test data , the auto - number sequence is preserved and the next non - test record will have a contiguous auto - number value of n-0051 .
you can enable this option from setup by clicking develop > apex test execution > options ... , selecting independent auto - number sequence , and clicking ok .
note that gaps in the auto - number sequence can still occur in other situations , for example , when triggers that attempt to insert new records fail to execute and records are rolled back .
in this case , gaps ca n’t be completely avoided because , in the same transaction , some records can be successfully inserted while others are rolled back .

datacloud objects are external objects that function differently from standard objects .
this table explains some of the differences .
logical operator = ! = % like datacloud function the equal sign searches for the exact string enclosed in single quotation marks .
for example : select contactid , lastname , firstname , city , companyname from datacloudcontact where city = ' albuquerque ' the not equal sign excludes the exact string enclosed in single quotation marks from the search . select contactid , lastname , firstname , city , companyname from datacloudcontact where city ! = ' albuquerque ' •
the datacloud objects recognize only the first wild card . •
wild cards placed after the first wild card are ignored .
when you use the “ like ” operator with datacloud objects , a wild card search is implicitly done .
the search done with the like operator is a “
fuzzy ” search .
some common spelling and omissions may still return results , for example searching on “ bob ” also returns results for “ robert . ” 328 force.com development data.com api purchasing data.com records purchase a contact or company record that you want to “ own .

custom objects • custom tabs • field sets • record types • validation rules 342 force.com development usage metrics —
pilot the deletion of these components was not supported previously , to avoid the risk of data loss or integration failures in subscriber organizations .
however , the number of such components in a complex package can grow very large over multiple release cycles .
the ability to delete managed components can be very useful in such cases .
it gives isvs greater flexibility in maintaining and upgrading their apps .
deleting any component will permanently delete any data that exists in that component , delete tracked history data , and change any integrations that rely on the component , such as assignment or escalation rules .
also , once you delete a component in a managed package , you ca n’t restore it or create another component with the same name .
no data or metadata is ever deleted in a subscriber organization without specific action by the customer .
subscribers who upgrade to the new package version will still have the deleted components available in their organization .
they ’re displayed in the unused components section of the package details page .
this ensures subscribers have the opportunity to export data and modify custom integrations involving those components , before explicitly deleting them .
for example , before deleting custom objects or fields , customers can preserve a record of their data by going to setup and clicking data management > data export .
note :  it ’s your responsibility to educate your customers about the potential impact from any components you delete .
you should list all custom components you 've deleted and notify customers of any actions they need to take , in the release notes for your upgraded package .
the following restrictions apply when deleting managed components . •
a component of any type is not deletable if it ’s referenced by any other metadata , such as workflow rules , validation rules , or apex classes . •
a custom object is not deletable if it includes any of the following : apex sharing reason , apex sharing recalculation , related lookup filter , compact layout , or action . • deleting a custom field that is referenced by a custom report type in the same package is not recommended , as that will lead to an error when installing the upgraded package .
you can delete managed components , both declaratively , from the user interface , and programmatically , using the metadata api .
in the latter case , specify the components you want to delete in a destructivechanges.xml manifest file and then use the standard deploy ( ) call .
the process is identical to that for deleting components that are n’t managed .
for more information , see the metadata api developer ’s guide .
usage metrics —
pilot note :  this feature is currently available through a pilot program .
for information on enabling it for your organization , please contact salesforce.com .
available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions
in spring ' 14 , you can collect detailed usage metrics from each organization in which your managed package is installed .
by analyzing this information , you can gain valuable insights into the utilization and performance of your app across your entire customer base .
for example , you can identify : •
the features most and least used — this can help you prioritize your development efforts when planning the next version of your app . •
the customers using your app most intensively — these are your most valuable customers . •
the customers whose usage of your app is minimal or declining — these are the customers most at risk of attrition
. you can collect the following daily metrics on two types of components in a managed package .
343 force.com development usage metrics —
pilot • custom objects — the total number of records stored per organization in each custom object .
this enables you to track how the usage of that custom object is growing with time in any subscriber organization , which is a reliable indicator of how much it 's being utilized • visualforce pages — the number of times per organization each visualforce page was accessed , the number of unique users who accessed it , and the average loading time ( in milliseconds ) .
by comparing the metrics for different visualforce pages , you can determine the relative popularity of different parts of your app in a specific customer organization , as well as trends across all customers .
the custom objects data is a snapshot that reflects the state of the organization at the time the database was sampled , while the visualforce data covers usage over a 24-hour period .
the usage metrics data for all production organizations in a given instance is merged and written into a text file , in a specified format , once a day .
currently , no data is collected on packages installed in sandbox organizations .
this feature is intended for api access only .
you must write a custom process to collect the metrics data from the reporting organization , and export it to a system of your choice for analysis .
this gives you the maximum flexibility to monitor and analyze the usage trends most relevant for your app .
your customers’ consent is not required for usage data to be collected , and there ’s no way for them to opt out .
this ensures you receive complete data for your entire customer base .
allowing some users to be excluded would skew the results , making the data less useful .
note :  if any of your customers have concerns about privacy , reassure them any data collected is limited to usage statistics .
no customer data is ever exposed to the isv under any circumstances .
this is consistent with salesforce.com’s emphasis on trust as a core value .
setting up usage metrics accessing usage metrics data the metricsdatafile object setting up usage metrics to set up usage metrics for any package , two organizations have special importance .
• release organization — the development edition organization used to upload the package .
• reporting organization — the organization to which the usage data is delivered , on a daily basis .
the release organization and reporting organization must be members of the same environment hub .
this is a security feature , to ensure usage data is only delivered to an organization controlled by the developer of the package .
to set up usage metrics for a package : 1 .
set up environment hub , if you haven’t already done so .
for instructions on setting up environment hub and connecting organizations to it , refer to the isvforce guide . 2 .
connect the release organization to the environment hub .

the html format of the force.com apex code developer ’s guide has been updated to improve user experience .
this update builds on the changes to apex class topics that were introduced in winter ’14 .
this update addresses issues with navigation in the html version .
apex class topics in the reference section have been merged to provide a single page for each class .
each class topic contains descriptions of all its methods .
the method summary is presented in a single list in one class , which enables faster scanning of methods .
you can still obtain the static and instance information from the method signature in each method description .
in addition , unnecessary sections have been removed from some method descriptions to make the reference section more compact in the html and pdf versions of the guide .
as a result of this restructuring , urls of method topics changed , and you might have to update your bookmarks .
if you get 404 not found errors in your browser , it might be because topics with outdated urls are being accessed from your browser ’s cache .
to avoid receiving these errors , clear your browser ’s cache from your browsing history .
