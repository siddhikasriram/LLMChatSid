just assign the sales user permission set license to your users in sales roles who need enterprise territory management .

see the user detail page for a specific user ’s assignment .
tip :  permission set licenses and permission sets are n’t the same .
a permission set license lets users access features that are n’t included in their user license .

process automation processes can execute actions on more than one criteria
now you can choose what happens after your process executes a specific action group .
should the process stop , or should it continue evaluating the next criteria in the process ?
it ’s up to you !
best of all , executing multiple action groups in a single process makes it easy to manage all of your processes for a given object , like a case , in one place .
give your lightning experience and salesforce1 users the power of flows ( pilot ) the day is finally here !
we ’re rolling out a flow component for the lightning app builder .
you can now add flows to any lightning page – app pages , record pages , and home pages alike .
trust percent values in flow sobject variables
again ( critical update ) have you added special calculations to your flow to get the right output for a percent field ?
this critical update lets you remove those workarounds .
access cross - object owner fields in flow some fields have relationships to more than one object .
we call these relationships polymorphic .
for example , if you have queues enabled for cases , a case owner can be either a user or queue .
if you ’re traversing from a case to its owner id , add special syntax to identify which object you mean when you say “
owner ” .
59 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning experience features in this release setup control which users immediately switch when lightning experience is enabled we heard you !
before enabling lightning experience , you need the power to decide who gets immediately switched to the new interface and who stays in salesforce classic .
now you can make these choices , with the new switch users to lightning experience option in the lighting experience migration assistant .
edit objects directly from the setup menu in lightning experience now you can edit objects and see object details with fewer clicks .
on object home and record pages , you can select edit object from the setup menu to go directly to that object ’s detail page .
view your lightning record pages in the object manager we added a lightning record pages related list to all objects that support record page editing in the lightning app builder .
you can see all the custom record pages you ’ve created for that object and which record page is active .
search lightning experience setup with global search
now you can use global search instead of quick find to find specific setup records , such as the lead source picklist or the sales rep profile .
data import data import wizard enhancements for matching by external id for any object , you can specify an external id field for the data import wizard to find existing records that match the import data . if your import is adding only new records , the data import wizard ignores the import file rows that contain matching values for the external id field .
if your import is updating existing records , the data import wizard uses the import file ’s data to update the matching records in salesforce .
data import wizard enhancements for email notifications when you import data via the data import wizard , the csv file that you submit is queued for processing .
when the import is complete , we notify you by email .
we ’ve expanded the email subject to include the csv filename and the number of record rows it contains .
now you can quickly tell which import the email is about .
external data you say potato , i say salesforce connect lightning connect is now called salesforce connect , and the salesforce adapter is now called the cross - org adapter .
while we were updating the user interface to reflect the new names , we also did some text housecleaning .
control whether an external object is searchable now you can decide whether to let users find an external object ’s records via sosl and salesforce global searches .
for each external object , select or deselect the new allow search  option .
to make searches faster across your org , disable search for external objects that your users do n’t need to search .
have your hyphens and search them too hyphens are no longer removed from search query strings that salesforce connect odata adapters send to external systems .
now your users who search salesforce for strings that include hyphens can find more relevant external object records .
if you ’ve set up your external system to handle the absence of hyphens in search query strings , make sure that including hyphens does n’t break your searches .
separately load related lists with fewer clicks back in winter ’16 , we added a user interface setting to separately load related lists of external objects .
to spare you from extra clicks , we ’ve added common - sense dependencies between that setting and the one for separately loading related lists of standard and custom objects .
60 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning experience features in this release
other changes in customization
for whom the data loads in the data loader for windows installer , we clarified a step that was confusing .
in that step , what you select determines who can use data loader and whether data loader can run automated processes on the machine .
the data loader for windows installer now explains the step so that you can make the correct choice .
security and identity save the day by generating a temporary verification code for users in distress generate a temporary identity verification code for users who forgot , lost , or otherwise ca n’t access the device they usually use for two - factor authentication .
the user can log in and stay productive , and you do n’t have to weaken security for your salesforce org or community by removing the two - factor authentication requirement .
delegate two - factor authentication management tasks a new permission lets you delegate some two - factor authentication support tasks to users who are n’t salesforce admins .
all users with the “ manage users ” permission also have the new permission , and you ca n’t remove it from those users . changed name for “ manage two - factor authentication ”
permission for clarity , we ’ve changed the name of the “ manage two - factor authentication ” permission to “ manage two - factor authentication in api . ”
the name change distinguishes this permission from the new permission “ manage two - factor authentication in user interface . ” simplify salesforce navigation with the user switcher with the user switcher , users can now easily navigate salesforce when they have multiple usernames on the same or different salesforce orgs .
they select their profile picture to see a list of available usernames to navigate to .
users no longer have to open a new tab , enter a login url , and then enter their username .
their browsers are n’t cluttered with several tabs , one for each salesforce org .
now users can have a single tab for all salesforce orgs .
email notifications to users
confirm added verification methods when an identity verification method is added to a user ’s account , the user gets an email .
the email notification increases security for your users’ accounts .
see how your
users are verifying their identity we ’ve made it easier for you to secure your salesforce org or community with two - factor authentication by adding tools that show you how your users are verifying their identity .
with knowledge about who ’s not using your preferred verification methods , you can refine your roll - out strategy and target communications to just the right people .
maintain identity verification on public or shared devices
now when your users log in to salesforce and verify their identity on a device that is n’t private , they can help keep your org secure by alerting us .
ask your users to deselect the “
do n’t ask again ” option that appears on the identity verification page when they ’re using a shared device or browser .
deselecting this option keeps us asking for identity verification whenever anyone logs in from that browser and device .
implement advanced authentication for ios users of custom domains if you have a custom domain created with my domain , you have a new option to support authentication methods , such as kerberos , windows nt lan manager ( ntlm ) , or certificate - based authentication , for users of salesforce1 and mobile sdk applications on ios devices .
when enabled , ios users are redirected to their native browser when using single sign - on authentication into your custom domain .
improved session security for oauth 1.0 token exchanges
when a connected app requests access to salesforce data via the user interface during an oauth 1.0 token exchange , salesforce validates the request and sends a short - lived session id that is valid only for frontdoor.jsp .
previously , the session id could be used in the api and was eligible for validity extensions .
to disable this feature , contact salesforce .
61 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning experience features in this release get more specific login type reporting in login history when users use an authentication provider ’s single sign - on ( sso ) to access your salesforce org through a customer service or partner portal , we provide more detailed entries in login history .
previously , these login types were recorded as customer service portal and partner portal , respectively .
now they ’re recorded as customer service portal third - party sso and partner portal third - party sso .
endpoint routing for user interface logins
no longer supported we ’re changing our endpoint routing to deliver better performance and higher availability for our dedicated user interface login endpoints .
previously , you could use www.salesforce.com/login.jsp as a user interface login endpoint , which then routed you to the correct login instance .
as of june 25 , 2016 , we are removing internal routing , and you have to change your user interface login endpoints from www.salesforce.com/login.jsp to https://login.salesforce.com/login.jsp .
this change applies only to user interface login traffic .
logging in from a browser by clicking login still works .
identity verification labels and email are easier to understand to reflect recent enhancements to our identity verification procedures , we ’ve changed some labels in the user interface and slightly revised an email your users get when verifying their identity .
deployment development improve app - level messaging with powerful , accessible toasts jazz up your app ’s popup messaging with new attributes on the force : showtoast  api event .
the new toasts entity is designed for mobile and desktop apps , and includes support for new features and enhanced user interface design .
manage logging more easily gone are the days of hunting all around setup to set up trace flags on users , apex classes , and apex triggers .
you can now create all three trace flag types in one setup location : the debug logs page .
easily enable logging on automated processes .
and , manage your debug levels on the new debug levels page in setup .
view time zones in debug logs debug logs now include time zone information for activity timestamps .
previously , you could n’t tell from a debug log which time zone the logged activities occurred in .
view visualforce controller exceptions in debug logs debug logs now include exceptions thrown by visualforce controllers .
visualforce controller exceptions have been visible in the salesforce user interface , but the exceptions looked like successes in the debug log .
review debug logs without sifting through extra log lines each debug log needs only one user_info  log line to record the timestamp in the user ’s time zone .
but user_info  lines were sometimes written for each component being traced .
we ’ve fixed this bug .
manage your apex debugger sessions in lightning experience the apex debugger page in setup is now available in lightning experience .
you can purchase apex debugger licenses for your parent org and share them among the users in your org ’s sandboxes .
view and terminate active sessions for your org and its sandboxes on the apex debugger page in setup .
picklists have an updated look picklists in lightning experience have been updated to match the look and feel of other menus in the ui .
visualforce for lightning experience is generally available with this release , visualforce is fully supported in lightning experience . 62 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning experience features in this release set the page title in lightning experience with the < apex : page > title attribute
in prior releases of lightning experience setting the page title of a visualforce page had no effect .
with this release , you can set the page ’s title using the title attribute of the < apex : page >  tag .
this sets the text used in browser windows , tabs , and bookmarks , and makes using lightning experience in multiple tabs a better experience .
view apex test results
more easily the new apex test history page shows all the test results associated with a test run .
the page shows results only for tests that have been run asynchronously .
simplify development of asynchronous callouts by using named credentials you can now use named credentials in long - running asynchronous callouts from a visualforce page ’s controller .
a named credential specifies the url of a callout endpoint and its required authentication parameters in one definition .
salesforce manages all authentication for callouts that specify a named credential as the callout endpoint so that your apex code does n’t have to .
you can also skip remote site settings , which are otherwise required for callouts to external sites , for the site defined in the named credential .
turn appexchange checkout data into insights and actions the checkout management app ( cma ) brings the power of salesforce to appexchange checkout .
a beautiful dashboard visually displays appexchange checkout data , so it ’s easy to see how your offerings are performing .
automated email notifications keep customers and team members in the loop whenever activity occurs on your offerings .
peruse developer tool download links without logging in we ’ve cleaned up the tools page in setup and made it easier to access what you need .
this page now contains only three links , and groups the tools into categories : a comprehensive list of force.com tools and toolkits , integration tools on the appexchange , and admin and developer tools on the appexchange .
the linked pages feature more tools than the setup page did , and you can access them without logging in to salesforce .
general enhancements get more insight into whether you ’re ready for lightning experience run the lightning experience readiness check to evaluate some of the sales cloud features and customizations you ’re using in salesforce classic .
that way , you can learn which are ready for lightning experience and which need your attention before you migrate your users .
welcome your users to lightning experience when users find themselves in lightning experience , they ’re met with a message to welcome them to the new interface .
and if users are n’t ready to explore lightning experience yet ?
no problem — we provide step - by - step , pop - up instructions that describe how to switch back to salesforce classic .
automatically get geocodes for addresses ( generally available ) help your sales and marketing teams find nearby prospects , assign territories and campaigns , and more !
all this is a cinch with geocodes .
in just a few clicks , you can set up and activate the geocode clean rules for your org .
then , geocodes are added for addresses on existing and new accounts , contacts , and leads .
change a record ’s owner
more easily in lightning experience your users can now change a record ’s owner from more places in lightning experience .
the change owner action is available in the record ’s highlights panel , the actions bar , and as an icon in the owner field on all records where the user has permission to change the owner .
more helpful presentation of internal error messages
hopefully your users never experience an internal error message .
but for those rare occasions , we ’ve updated the appearance and content of these messages so non - technical users are better able to understand the situation .
and optionally , users now can send us information about what they were doing before the error occurred , right from the message .
which helps us make these occurrences even more scarce , so thank you !

68 salesforce summer ’16 release notes more ownership options for financial accounts we ’ve also simplified the setup task of configuring reciprocal roles .
when you create reciprocal role records to describe how entities are related to clients and households , you no longer have to create two records per relationship .
create one record and we automatically create another to represent the inverse .
for example , let ’s say that you save a reciprocal role record with the role of client and the inverse role of power of attorney .
we automatically create a corresponding record with the role of power of attorney and the inverse role of client .
more ownership options for financial accounts previously , a financial account owner had to be an individual client .
now , you can designate an organizational entity , such as a business or a trust , as a primary or joint owner .
if an individual client and an organizational entity jointly own a financial account , the primary ownership determines whether the account balance is included in roll - up summaries . •

the roles that people have in the healthcare world are incredibly varied .
so we ’ve given you the flexibility to change the standard health cloud roles to ones that reflect how your organization works .
changes to objects and fields to support platform encryption , we ’ve changed which field contains the patient medical record number .

we ’ve given you the ability to localize the labels on the patient card and the health timeline .

limits for industries rest api you can retrieve a maximum of 200 records in one request instead of the 2,000 records previously documented .
care plan and timeline get more elbow room we ’ve put the care plan and health timeline on separate tabs to provide care coordinators with more space to work and to increase performance .
active field added to timeline view configurations tab we ’ve added the active  field to the timeline view configurations tab .
secure protected health information with salesforce shield take compliance , governance , and security of protected health information ( phi ) data even further with salesforce shield .
health cloud now supports salesforce shield — helping your organization to more easily implement health cloud in a manner that ’s compliant with your policies and procedures for handling phi .
shield is a trio of security tools that developers can use to build a new level of trust , transparency , compliance , and governance into business - critical apps .
salesforce shield is a separately licensed set of services that includes platform encryption , event monitoring , and field audit trail .
• event monitoring gives visibility into user actions and prevents malicious use .
• platform encryption protects data at rest while preserving functionality like search , workflow , and validation rules . •
field audit trail lets you know the state and value of your data for any date , at any time .
multiple languages supported access health cloud in six new languages .
health cloud supports all the locales supported by the salesforce platform and with summer ’16 , we ’ve added these additional languages . •
dutch • english ( uk ) • french • german • portuguese ( brazil ) • spanish • spanish ( mexico ) if your company is multi - language and operates in a non - english language , enable the translation workbench so that translated values display correctly in health cloud components .
product documentation is available in all fully supported languages .
it ’s easier to create lists of patients we ’ve made some usability improvements to the wizard that you and your care coordinators use to create patient lists .
now , when you select the records or fields to use in filter criteria , type a few letters in the lookup and select from a dynamic list of matching records or fields .
then , when you select a field , the new input field matches the type of data you need to enter in the field .
for example , if you select a discharge date field , then a date field appears in the wizard .
or if the field you select is a picklist field type , then the picklist values appear .
the following lookup types change the type of input field that appears .
72 salesforce summer ’16 release notes customize the delivered care team roles • date and date / time •
boolean • picklist • record type customize the delivered care team roles
the roles that people have in the healthcare world are incredibly varied .
so we ’ve given you the flexibility to change the standard health cloud roles to ones that reflect how your organization works .
your organization might be an extended care facility and call the people you manage residents rather than patients .
or instead of care coordinators , you have case managers who interact with patients .
it ’s easy to change the text that appears throughout the app .
from setup , enter custom metadata  in the quick find box , then select custom metadata types .
clone the careplan role care coordinator  setting or the careplan role patient  setting .
then , deactivate the original setting and make the new record active .
changes to objects and fields to support platform encryption , we ’ve changed which field contains the patient medical record number .
we ’ve added the custom field medicalrecordnumber__c to the following objects : account , contact , ehrpatient__c , and candidatepatient__c .
this field replaces sourcesystemid , which held a patient ’s medical record number or other patient id in winter ’16 .
localize labels on the patient card and health timeline
we ’ve given you the ability to localize the labels on the patient card and the health timeline .
now you can localize the friendly name  field on the patient card and the health timeline and the object name  field on the health timeline .
to create the label text in another language , clone the configuration record for the patient card or health timeline text .
add the label text to the friendly name  or object name  field using the language you want to display .
next , set the language field of the new record to that language .
the system displays the label text that matches the user ’s language setting .
since you ca n’t have two records with the same assigned sort order , create a different version number for the new record .
for example , if the english record has 3  in the sort order  field , then assign the spanish version 3.1 .
here ’s an example of the text medications  that appears on the patient card .
it has an entry for both english and spanish .
when a care coordinator uses the console as a spanish language user , medicamentos  appears on the patient card with a list of medications for that patient .
since it has a sort order of 3.1 , it appears as the third item on the patient card for that user .
note :  if you do n’t see the language  or language code fields on the tab , add the fields to the related page layout and refresh the tab .
73 salesforce summer ’16 release notes medical record number no longer required in patient creation process medical record number no longer required in patient creation process we understand that your company might not use an mrn to track candidate patients , so the medical record number  field is no longer required to convert a candidate patient .
however , salesforce uses the medicalrecordnumber__c  and sourcesystem__c  fields to check for duplicate patient records during the patient creation process .
you can create a validation rule to verify that all candidate patient records have values in these fields before converting candidate patient records .
limits for industries rest api you can retrieve a maximum of 200 records in one request instead of the 2,000 records previously documented .
care plan and timeline get more elbow room we ’ve put the care plan and health timeline on separate tabs to provide care coordinators with more space to work and to increase performance .
note :  existing health cloud orgs still show the care plan and timeline option in the new tab on patient picklist on the patient card .
remove the menu item by deleting the care plan and timeline  category name from the cardview dropdown custom setting .

but john is also involved with the nonprofit organization greendot media .
by adding greendot media as a related account on john ’s contact record ( 2 ) , reps can track this other relationship .

remember when emails in salesforce were just saved as tasks ?
it was pretty convenient , but it was n’t great for customizing and viewing emails .
womp womp .
well , the times they are a - changin’ !
with enhanced email , emails sent from salesforce are saved as emailmessage records .
emailmessage is n’t a new object , but we ’ve beefed it up to give you more bang for your buck .
emailmessage is a standard salesforce object , so you get all the usual goodies you have with other standard objects .
you can : • customize the page layout for email messages • use the salesforce api to manage emails • set up triggers based on emails • add custom fields to emails your reps can : • relate emails to contacts , leads , accounts , opportunities , cases , campaigns , person accounts , and other records . • view emails in their original format like they ’ve come to expect you might be wondering : i have a bunch of stuff configured to handle emails as tasks , so what do i do ?
well , for backwards compatibility , we still create a task record for each email .
however , when your reps view emails in salesforce , they see the emailmessage record .
that ’s a good thing , because it shows emails in their original format .
so , html emails show the html format , and plain text emails show plain text format .
that ’s what your users expect .
note :  if you use email - to - case , see enhanced email enabled by default before enabling the feature .

this section : considerations for syncing events before you roll out lightning sync to your sales reps , familiarize yourself with these considerations for syncing events .
that way , your rollout generates no surprises . 117 salesforce
summer ’16 release notes microsoft® integration : sync and work between microsoft systems and salesforce guidelines for rolling out event sync before you roll out lightning sync , address these guidelines to avoid overwriting event data during certain sync scenarios .
considerations for syncing events before you roll out lightning sync to your sales reps , familiarize yourself with these considerations for syncing events .
that way , your rollout generates no surprises .
first , does one of these scenarios describe your rollout ? •
you ’re migrating reps from salesforce for outlook •
your reps edit their events records in salesforce •
your reps already have access to lightning for outlook ( previously known as salesforce app for outlook ) if one does , keep in mind that there is potential for lightning sync to overwrite event data unless you ’re considerate about how you roll out the feature to your reps .
for example , say that your rep maintains meeting notes in salesforce event records .
but the matching event in that rep ’s exchange - based calendar does n’t include those notes .
during the first sync , lightning sync overwrites the event in salesforce with the one from the calendar .
to avoid overwriting event data , make sure you review guidelines for rolling out event sync .
guidelines for rolling out event sync
before you roll out lightning sync , address these guidelines to avoid overwriting event data during certain sync scenarios . •
in lightning sync configurations , do n’t change the default setting , today , for the event sync filter .
that way , edits that your reps made to past events in salesforce are excluded from the initial sync . •
tell reps that events sync from microsoft® exchange - based calendars to salesforce . •
tell reps to edit event fields that sync ( like date , time , subject , or description ) in their calendars , and not in salesforce .
that way , lightning sync does n’t overwrite those edits in salesforce .
( reps can continue to use features in salesforce that do n’t sync with their calendars , however , like relating events to salesforce records . )
sales reps can delete syncing events in one action help your reps manage their events efficiently .
set up reps to delete events from both their exchange - based calendars and salesforce in one action .
to let reps delete syncing events in one action , select automatically remove deleted exchange events from salesforce on your reps’ sync configurations .
then , reps can delete events from their exchange - based calendar , and lightning sync deletes the event ’s counterpart in salesforce .
because lightning sync only syncs from exchange to salesforce , lightning sync delete only works when sales reps delete events from their exchange - based email .
if reps delete a syncing event from salesforce , the event ’s counterparts remains in exchange .
events that reps move out of their default exchange calendar and into a secondary calendar are also deleted from salesforce .

now you can set up your reps to select only the exchange events they want to sync to salesforce .
your reps already use lightning for outlook to relate important events from their outlook calendars to salesforce records .
however , if reps edit those outlook events , changes are n’t captured in salesforce unless reps add changes manually .
now you can set an option to sync those related events between outlook and salesforce .
that way , changes reps make to outlook events they ’ve related to salesforce records are added to salesforce automatically .
and best of all , the option lets reps choose which exchange events sync to salesforce , rather than committing reps to syncing all their events .
follow these steps to set up reps to select which exchange events sync to salesforce .

120 salesforce summer ’16 release notes data quality : view a data.com data assessment in lightning experience we encourage reps to transition to extended mail merge , which is compatible with salesforce - support versions of tls , like tls 1.1 and higher .
extended mail merge is different from standard mail merge because it lets reps generate salesforce mail merges without requiring reps to install software .
instead , reps generate mail merges directly from salesforce records .
and because there ’s no need to install software , there are no systems requirements that restrict users working from certain computing environments .
extended mail merge does n’t create mail merge templates automatically .
however , reps can generate mail merges using templates they created previously using standard mail merge , or create templates manually in word .
to create templates manually , reps can use the “ url to locate record field names for mail merge ” article to learn which salesforce fields are available for reference in templates .
after reps create templates , reps can upload templates to salesforce , and then generate them directly from salesforce records .
to get started with extended mail merge , call salesforce customer support to enable the feature for your org .

122 salesforce summer ’16 release notes data quality : view a data.com data assessment in lightning experience your account data is given an overall health score that ’s calculated using three factors .
• matchability — matchability reflects how easy it is to keep your crm records up - to - date and complete using dun & bradstreet referential data .
highly matchable crm records generally have good fill - rates for key identifiers , such as address fields and company website .
a higher rating for matchability improves you overall data health rating .
• accuracy — accuracy is a measure of the percentage of your account records that are complete and up - to - date when compared to the dun & bradstreet data set .
if valuable marketing and sales data , such as firmographics and financials , is incomplete or out - of - date , the usefulness of the record is diminished .
a higher rating for accuracy improves the overall data health rating .
• uniqueness — uniqueness is based on the number of duplicate accounts that were identified from the matched records .
the presence of duplicates creates issues affecting the ability to find and report on data , reducing employee productivity , and decreasing user satisfaction .
a higher rating for uniqueness improves the overall data health rating .
the match analysis provides a summary of the percentages of matched and up - to - date records , matched and outdated records , and unmatched records .
• matched up - to - date —
percentage of account records with all fields exactly matching the dun & bradstreet data set .
• matched outdated —
percentage of account records with some fields differing from the dun & bradstreet data set .
• unmatched — percentage of account records that were not able to be matched to the dun & bradstreet data set .
123 salesforce summer ’16 release notes other changes in the sales cloud important :  if your unmatched percentage seems unusually high , it ’s possible that you are n’t using the standard fields on which we match .

customer segmentation customer segmentation gives you detailed breakdowns by industry , geography , employee count , and annual revenue .
the customer segmentation charts provide a graphic view of the potential fields for which data.com can provide more up - to - data and accurate data .

change to record ownership flow during lead conversion there is a change in behavior when a user converts a lead into a new account , contact , or opportunity and assigns that new record to a separate user .
this feature is available in lightning experience , salesforce classic , and all versions of the salesforce1 app .
previously , in spring ‘ 16 and earlier , upon creation of the new record , the system first assigned it to the user performing the lead conversion .
the system then completed the conversion process by reassigning the new record to the separate user .
this scenario had effects on workflows and apex code .
• workflow logic triggered by record creation that evaluates whether that separate user is the record owner would fail , because the record is first assigned to the user performing the conversion . •
for customers who use a private sharing model for accounts , contacts , or opportunities , apex logic that accesses the new record during lead conversion would succeed , because the new account is first owned by the user performing the conversion .
in summer ‘ 16 , the system now immediately assigns the new account , contact , or opportunity to the separate user chosen by the user who is converting the lead .
the new record is never owned by the user performing the conversion .
this change affects workflows and apex code . • workflow logic triggered by record creation that evaluates whether that separate user is the record owner will succeed , because that user is the first and only owner . •
for customers who use a private sharing model for accounts , contacts , or opportunities , apex logic that accesses the new record during lead conversion will fail , because the record is not owned by the user performing the conversion .
for example , let ’s say steve converts a lead to an account and assigns that new account to michelle during the conversion .
a workflow triggered by account record creation that evaluates whether michelle is the account owner will succeed .
however , with a private sharing model , apex code that tries to access the new account record during the conversion process will fail , because steve is not the owner of the new account record .

say that sarah , after many years , has retired and left the company .
as salesforce admin , part of your job is removing the reports saved in sarah ’s private folder .
running a soql query using the allprivate  scope gives you access to sarah ’s private reports .
but what if you ca n’t delete one report because it ’s used by dashboard components ?
previously , it was a challenge to identify which dashboard components used sarah ’s private reports .
now , a soql query does the trick .
first , run a soql query on the dashboardcomponent sobject .
in this example , the report with the i d 00or0000000pbzzma4 is a report saved in sarah ’s private folder . select i d , dashboardid , customreportid from dashboardcomponent using scope allprivate where customreportid = ‘ 00or0000000pbzzma4’ the query returns a list of dashboard components that use sarah ’s private report as a source .
with this list in hand , you can quickly account for the report ’s associated dashboard components and then delete the report .

you can now include wave assets in packages , and developers , partners , and isvs can deploy , license , and manage wave apps on appexchange .
this lays the foundation for a whole new ecosystem .
a wave of wave apps is coming !
wave assets can be packaged in the same way as standard salesforce components , using the same tools .
your apps , dashboards , lenses , datasets , and dataflows can be easily distributed to your users . 135 salesforce summer ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level
but there ’s more !
partners such as isvs and oems can deploy wave assets as managed apps .
packaging leverages salesforce and wave metadata , so wave apps are seamlessly integrated with force.com ; there is no dividing line .
upgrade , delete , and deprecate operations are supported .
change sets honor wave metadata too , making it easy to send customizations and wave assets from one salesforce org to another , like from sandbox to production .
partners who wish to make their wave app available for sale and/or installation can do so by publishing to appexchange .
customers can browse these packages on appexchange and install them into their orgs .
have an amazing idea for an analytical app ?
build your business on wave !
your appexchange offerings can be managed via the license management application , where you can specify the licensing options , and create lead and license records for each install of your package .
partners can control the usage of their wave apps by the number of users .
administrators can assign these licenses to the users , subject to the terms of the license .
note :  partners wishing to publish wave apps on appexchange should talk to their pam ( partner account manager ) and te ( technical evangelist ) contacts at salesforce .
refer to the wave migration , packaging and distribution help topic .
the following table shows the wave components that are available in a managed package , and whether each is updateable , or can be deleted .

key to column headings : upgradeable some components are updated to a newer version when a package is upgraded . subscriber deletable a subscriber or installer of a package can delete the component .
developer deletable a developer can delete some components after the package is uploaded as managed - released .
deleted components are not deleted in the subscriber 's organization during a package upgrade .
protectable developers can mark certain components as protected , so they ca n’t be referenced by components elsewhere .
136 salesforce summer ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level ip protection intellectual property protection , such as obfuscation .
there are some good practices and points to be aware of when packaging wave assets .
• wave admin permissions are required to create a package , but not for deployment , which requires only salesforce admin permissions . •
there is no spidering between datasets and dataflows , meaning there is no dependency following .
when packaging both , they must be added manually .
if they are not , an error appears during deployment .
the same is true for change sets - when packaging both datasets and dataflows , add them manually . •
images do n't render when deploying a dashboard that uses an image widget that references an image file not available on the target org .
you must manually upload the image , and the document id of the image file in the image widget must be updated .
the user ca n’t save the dashboard in the target with an invalid document id , but they can still view and edit it . •
if a dashboard you 're deploying has a link widget pointing to another dashboard that exists in the target org , you must manually update the link reference to point to the right one .
if the linked dashboard does n't exist in the target org , you 'll see an error message .
either deploy the linked dashboard too , or re - create the linked dashboard in the target org .
update the link widget to point to the linked dashboard . •
take care when packaging dataflows .
invalid schema overrides , and unsupported or illegal parameters will be removed ( for example , type = dim  is no longer supported , it 's now type = text ) .
comments in json will be removed .
nodes might appear in a different order .

click a step to clone it .
modify the clone in the explorer , and save it with the steps available for use in that dashboard .
if the step was created using saql , the clone opens in the saql editor instead of the explorer .
two types of steps ca n’t be cloned : a static step and a compare table that has a saql query for one or more of its columns .
note :  let ’s clarify the new word “ step ” in the flex designer .
a dashboard widget consists of a step plus a visualization .
the step is often a query that dynamically runs to show you different views of your data .
the step can also be static values pulled from your data .
either way , it ’s different from a lens .
a lens stands alone , while a step is only available in the dashboard designer .
when you clip a lens for use in a dashboard , you ’re sending the step part to the designer .

grouping allows you to move the widgets all at once with the existing spacing , eliminating the need to realign widgets after moving them .
previously , you could only apply an image as the background of a container widget .
150 salesforce summer ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level in addition , you can also overlay images by applying them to the dashboard background , container background , and image widget inside the container .
to create an image widget : 1 .
in the dashboard , add the image widget to the canvas and move it inside a container widget .
all widgets in the container are grouped . 2 .
to access the image widget properties , click the edit icon for the widget .
3 .
set the following properties .
property background image image scale image alignment : horizontal image alignment : vertical use defaults background color border border color description the 15-character document id of the image file to apply as the background .
to ensure security , upload the image file to salesforce as a document and select the externally available image option .
if the option is not selected , the document is not an image , or there is no corresponding document , no image appears .
default is null .
indicates how to scale the image .
valid values are : original ( default ) , stretch , tile , fit width , or fit height .

4 . save the change to the dashboard .
instantly update widgets in a dashboard selections in list , range , and date widgets that are expanded in the flex designer ( beta ) always instantly update other widgets .
unlike the previous release , you can no longer see nor set the update instantly property for these widgets to manually update other widgets .
note :  if these widgets are collapsed , the behavior is the same as before —
the property is available .
you can configure it for instantaneous or manual updates .
get familiar with dashboard json changes the dashboard json contains more properties to support the new features in flex designer ( beta ) .
if you work with json while building dashboards , take note of the changes .
the dashboard json contains the following new sections .
• gridlayoutstyle — contains settings for dashboard properties , such as background color and image , and cell spacing .
• widgetstyle — contains the default settings for widget properties .
image widget properties appear under “ widgets . ”
the background color and border properties of images , or any widget for that matter , appear under “ gridlayoutstyle . ”
the following sample dashboard json shows the new json sections and image widget properties .

create it today to take advantage of its more precise configuration wizard and simpler , more straightforward dashboards .
we ’ve rebuilt the app to help you get the value from your sales cloud data more faster than ever , either on desktop or mobile devices .
whether you ’re a sales manager or rep or you ’re in operations , we ’ve enhanced the app experience to help you move quickly from analysis to action .
the sales manager overview dashboard shows an overview of team key performance indicators ( kpis ) , such as quota attainment , pipe generation , and average sales cycle time .
from there , jump right to other dashboards with specifics , such as pipeline changes , quota progress , and team productivity .
or dig in to the dashboard to view the performance of individual members of the team .
sales reps now have their own path through sales cloud data .
starting with the new sales rep overview dashboard , review kpis and then review quota attainment , bookings , and pipeline for a particular time period .
and drill into key opportunities for accelerating deal closing to help you blast through your numbers for the quarter .
156 salesforce summer ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level sales operations staff can select from dashboards that visualize performance according to geography , source , customer , and product .
the dashboards help the operations team spot trends and analyze closed business data to help accelerate future sales .
additional configuration wizard settings give administrators more precise control over the app .
through its handy question and answer format , the wizard lets you bring in additional salesforce data to the app ’s datasets , select how to display geographic data , and control security settings .
create a new version of the app today create a new version of the app to take advantage of its enhancements , including the new upgrade feature that alerts you to new versions so you can instantly upgrade and start using new functionality .
go to the wave analytics home page and click create .
select app , then sales wave , and follow the instructions in the configuration wizard .
when you create the app from the new sales wave version , wave saves the previous version of the app along with any enhancements and customizations you ’ve made .
you can go into the original app and redo customizations in the new app .
the wave analytics platform license includes the sales wave analytics app license .
you can also purchase and use sales wave analytics separately from the wave platform .
for more specifics about getting started with sales wave , see the sales wave analytics app .
reset and upgrade features help you keep wave apps up to date wave apps now let you know there ’s a new version , upgrade to the new version , and make minor changes and restore your app .
after you create a wave analytics app — like sales wave — using the summer ‘
16 release , you ’ll have access to two new features .
the first is reset , which lets you make minor changes to an app you ’ve created and restore parts of it you deleted .
the second is upgrade , which you ’ll see only after we release a new version of an app after the summer ‘
16 release .
every time we release a new version , the app lets you know the new version ’s available and gives you the option to upgrade .
note :  the reset and upgrade features are n’t available for older apps created before the summer ‘ 16 .
reset app option resetting an app does the following : • lets you change your configuration wizard without having to delete the app and start over .
for example , say that you answered “
no ” to the question asking if you wanted to include products data in your dashboards when you created sales wave .
now you want to change the answer to “
yes . ”
the reset option lets you do that while leaving all other wizard answers as they were .
• restores dashboards if you ’ve deleted them .
• restores the whole app if you ’ve made customizations that render part or all of it unusable .
157 salesforce summer ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level wave apps display the reset option for apps created with the summer ‘ 16 release or upgraded to a new version after that .
apps created before summer ‘ 16 do n’t show that option .
to reset your app , click reset app to open the configuration wizard .
it ’s preloaded with the answers you chose the last time you created , upgraded , or reset the app .
you can then choose new settings as needed .
important :  resetting your app overwrites it , removing any customizations such as custom objects or fields added to the dataflow or changes to security settings and dashboard colors and labels .
before you reset , we recommend that you save copies of any part of an app you ’ve changed , including the dataflow definition file and dashboards .
after resetting , you then manually copy any changes into the reset app .
upgrade app option when salesforce releases an upgrade to a prebuilt app , you can upgrade the app to take advantage of the new features .
when you open a wave app after we release a new version , a banner tells you the new version is available .
click the link there to see what ’s new and start the upgrade process .
you can also upgrade by clicking new version available on the left side of the app home page .
158 salesforce summer ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level note :  when you first create an app using the summer ‘ 16 release , you wo n’t see the upgrade option until we release a new version . you can choose to create a new app or upgrade your current app . •
create new app
— lets you keep the current version and then manually copy customizations over to the new app .
if you ’ve customized any parts of your app , such as the dataflow or dashboards , we recommend that you use this option .
• upgrade app — overwrites the app , all its assets , and any customizations .
to preserve customizations , select create new app .
you can also preserve your changes by saving copies of the dataflow definition file and customized dashboards .
after you choose an option , you ’re taken to the configuration wizard .
it ’s preloaded with the answers you chose the last time you created the app .
you can either use the same answers or choose new ones .

the goal is to provide the right amount of information at the right time to help both managers and agents make the right decisions .
the app features a set of dashboards just for service managers to give them a complete view of service customer data , including trending as well as historical and peer benchmarks .
agents can quickly view a snapshot of each case and customer through sidebars that can be embedded directly in a salesforce page , such as the service console .
160 salesforce summer ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level we ’ve done the heavy - lifting , developing complex queries , benchmarking , historical trending , and visualizations that draw from your service data .
all you need to do is answer questions in the handy configuration wizard about the data and fields you ’d like to see .
if you ’re already using wave analytics , you can get started with service wave right away : your wave platform license automatically includes a service wave license .
here ’s what you need to do : 1 .
outfit your team with the right user permissions .
assign users the service analytics permission set license , create a permission set license with the right user permissions , and then assign it to people in your org .
for details , see “
set up salesforce permissions for the sales wave app ” in salesforce help . 2 .
admins with the right permissions can then create the app and share it with others in their org .
go to the wave home page , click in the upper right corner , select app , then service wave .
3 .

integrate data refresh your wave data more often with multiple dataflow runs per day .
simplify analysis with better hierarchy support .
in
this section : get data more frequently update your data more frequently by scheduling dataflows to run multiple times per day — up to every hour .
previously , dataflows ran only once per day .

get data
more frequently update your data more frequently by scheduling dataflows to run multiple times per day — up to every hour .
previously , dataflows ran only once per day .
to run on an hourly basis , select hour(s ) and then specify the interval details .
minute offset is the number of minutes past the hour to run the dataflow .
162 salesforce summer ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level hourly scheduled dataflows run relative to a fixed base time ( 00:00 utc ) .
for example , if you schedule a dataflow to run every 6 hours with a 15-minute offset , the dataflow is scheduled to run at 00:15 utc , 06:15 utc , 12:15 utc , and 18:15 utc , each day .
after you save the schedule , the scheduler specifies the time of the first dataflow run ( in your timezone ) .
tip :  when you schedule a dataflow , consider the dataflow limit—24 dataflow runs per day .
if you schedule it to run every hour and manually run it at least once , you hit the limit .
if you enable replication ( pilot ) , schedule the replication dataflow to complete before the user dataflow starts to ensure that the replicated datasets are available to the user dataflow .
you can set them to run on the same hourly interval , but start at different times .
for example , schedule them to run every six hours , but set the minute offset to 0 for the replication dataflow and 55 for the user dataflow .
for more information about replication and the different types of dataflows , see getting started with wave replication tipsheet .
build more complete hierarchies to enable users to run queries on the entire hierarchy , the flatten transformation can now include the self node of a hierarchy in the generated paths .
previously , the flatten transformation included only ancestor nodes in the hierarchy path .
for example , let ’s say you flatten the role hierarchy .
previously , the flatten transformation generated the roles and rolepath columns as shown in the following dataset .
now , the generated paths can include the self role id , which is shown in bold in the following dataset .
163 salesforce summer ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level to include the self id in the generated columns , set the new include_self_id  attribute of the flatten transformation to true , as shown in the following json snippet .
if you do n’t specify this attribute , wave excludes the self id .
" flatten_userrole " : { " action " : " flatten " , " parameters " : { " include_self_field" : true " self_field " : " i d " , " multi_field " : " roles " , " parent_field " : " parentroleid " , " path_field " : " rolepath " , " source " : " extract_userrole " } } develop on the wave platform developing on the wave platform just got a lot more powerful , with new saql functions and additional rest api support .

take advantage of new saql functionality wave ’s saql functionality continues to expand with exciting new functionality in windowing , aggregation , and string handling .
string functions a number of key string handling functions have been added .
• ltrim - returns the left part of a string up to the specified characters , or removes leading spaces .
• rtrim - returns the right part of a string back to the specified characters , or removes trailing spaces .
• trim - returns the left and right part of a string up to the specified characters , or removes leading and trailing spaces . 164 salesforce summer ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level • upper - returns the string with all characters in uppercase
. • lower - returns the string with all characters in lowercase .
• substr - returns a substring starting at a specified position and , optionally , of the specified length . •
len - returns the number of characters in the string .
aggregation functions wait , there 's more !
some important new aggregation functions have been added , too . •
percentile_disc - computes a specific percentile for sorted values in an entire rowset or within distinct partitions of a rowset . •
percentile_cont - calculates a percentile based on a continuous distribution of the column value .
• stddev - returns the sample standard deviation computed on the group .
• stddevp - returns the population standard deviation computed on the group .
• var - returns the sample variance ( also called the unbiased variance ) computed on the group .
• varp - returns the population variance ( also called the biased variance ) computed on the group . windowing
functions supporting the advanced windowing capabilities — introduced in the last release — now include : • count - number of groups passed to the window clause .
analogous to sum(1 ) .
• median - returns the middle value , or the average of two middle values if there are an even number of non - null values . •
percentile_disc and percentile_cont ( see aggregation functions ) .
booleans and null
value items for convenience , the boolean literals true and false are now available .
no need to use integers .
in most contexts , saql now allows the use of null anywhere a constant string or number would appear .
add annotations with the rest api annotate dashboard widgets with comments posted in the dashboard and in chatter .
new rest api endpoints and their associated representations .
annotations • /wave / annotations supports get and post . retrieves all available annotations , or creates new ones . • /wave
/ annotations/${annotationid } supports get and patch .
gets or updates a specific annotation . templates • /wave / templates/${templateidorapiname}/releasenotes supports get .

. ensure stellar service with milestones on work orders entitlement management and work orders are tying the knot , and you ’re invited !
with milestones now available on work orders , you can link entitlement to work orders and define and track required steps in your field service process .
this feature is available in lightning experience , salesforce classic , the salesforce1 mobile browser app , the salesforce1 downloadable app for android , version 9.0 or later , and the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios , version 10.0 or later .
previously , entitlement management was just available for cases .
now you can specify whether an entitlement process can enforce milestones on cases or on work orders .
the new entitlement process type  field indicates how the process will be used : editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions with the service cloud milestones help you enforce the terms in your customer support agreements .
for example , you can : • create an assignment milestone to ensure that new work orders are assigned to a technician within 1 hour of being created •
create a resolution time milestone to ensure that high - priority work orders are closed within 48 hours if entitlement management is already set up in your org , complete these steps to get started with milestones on work orders : 1 .
add the work orders related list to entitlement page layouts . 171 salesforce summer ’16 release notes field service 2 .
add the milestone tracker to work order feed layouts and as a custom console component to let agents keep an eye on active milestones .
3 .
add the milestones related list to work order page layouts to display the milestones on a work order . 4 .
add the following fields to work order page layouts . •
business hours —
the business hours that the work order follows •
entitlement name —
the entitlement associated with the work order •
entitlement process end date —
the date the entitlement process stops running on the work order •
entitlement process start date —
the date the entitlement process started running on the work order • milestone status —
the status of an active milestone • milestone status icon — an icon that corresponds to the milestone status 5 .
to view a list of work orders with milestones in your org , use the object milestones custom report type to create a work order report .
if you ’re new to entitlement management , see the entitlement management setup checklist .
important : • if you ’re using entitlement processes , we recommend that you manage customers’ work orders and cases on separate entitlements , because an entitlement process runs only on records that match its type .
for example , a case entitlement process that ’s applied to an entitlement runs only on associated cases , not work orders . • you ca n’t change an existing entitlement process ’s type , even when you ’re creating a new version .
entitlement processes created before summer ’16 use the case type . •
manage page layouts and validation rules for work order milestones from the new object milestones node in setup in salesforce classic .
considerations for lightning experience users • milestones are view only in lightning experience .
to manage milestones , switch to salesforce classic . •
the object milestones related list and milestone tracker are n’t available in lightning experience . •
clicking a milestone - related feed item on a work order in lightning experience redirects you to salesforce classic .
considerations for salesforce1 users • the milestone tracker is not available in salesforce1 .

when an agent enters a few letters of a person ’s name or email address , type ahead automatically suggests matching names and addresses , just as in gmail .
if multiple names or email addresses with the same letters match the letters that the agent entered , a drop - down appears showing all matches across contacts , leads , and users .

optionally , you can add the cc , bcc , and from fields , so that they ’re available for agents .

close popup windows like in lightning experience salesforce spell checker is replaced by browser - based spell check see more record data without scrolling salesforce1 : remember , ios 9.2 is required on ios devices as we shared with you in the spring ’16 release notes , summer ’16 marks the end of support for all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app on ios 9.1 and earlier .
this change is because of a compatibility issue between the upcoming release of the salesforce1 for ios downloadable app , version 10.0 and older versions of ios .
to ensure a smooth transition to summer ’16 , we recommend that your iphone and ipad users update their devices to ios 9.2 or later .
upgrading is especially important before installing salesforce1 for ios , version 10.0 because the new app wo n’t appear in the app store for devices with older os versions .
after summer ’16 , users with pre - ios 9.2 devices can continue to work with previously installed versions of the salesforce1 downloadable app .
and users are n’t prevented from accessing the salesforce1 mobile browser app on earlier ios versions .
if users encounter salesforce1 issues while working on an unsupported os , however , the availability of support services depends on the source of the problem .
salesforce will address issues that can also be reproduced on supported ios versions .
but salesforce no longer provides technical support , bug fixes , or enhancements to resolve issues that are specific to salesforce1 running on an unsupported version of ios .
your users can easily install the latest version of ios for free on their iphone and ipad devices .
for help upgrading ios , see update the ios software on your iphone , ipad , and ipod touch on the apple support site .
salesforce1 : new android tablet support for the downloadable app to increase device options for salesforce1 users , we now support use of the salesforce1 for android downloadable app on samsung galaxy note 10.1 tablets , running android 5.1.1 or later .
salesforce1 for android works in portrait orientation but does n’t rotate into landscape orientation .
202 salesforce summer ’16 release notes salesforce1 : news and insights , and continued productivity offline salesforce1 : new windows 10 phone support for the mobile browser app we ’ve added windows 10 support for the salesforce1 mobile browser app .
the mobile browser app is now available on microsoft lumia 950 phones when accessed from the microsoft edge mobile browser .
salesforce1 : the mobile browser app can run in some unsupported browsers on ios devices with summer ’16 , your iphone and ipad users have unsupported access to the salesforce1 mobile browser app from google chrome for ios and the gmail for ios app ’s webview .
previously , accessing salesforce1 from either of these browser environments was blocked and users were directed to salesforce classic instead .
important :  salesforce supports use of the salesforce1 mobile browser app in specific device and mobile browser combinations .
safari is the only mobile browser that ’s supported for ios devices .
( see requirements for the salesforce1 mobile app in the salesforce help for more details . )
while we ’ve opened up access to the mobile browser app from the ios mobile browsers mentioned here , these environments are not tested or supported and users may experience issues .
salesforce does n’t provide technical support , bug fixes , or enhancements to resolve any issues that your users may encounter when using salesforce1 in an unsupported mobile browser .
make your purchasing and salesforce1 rollout decisions based solely on the currently supported mobile device and mobile browser combinations .
salesforce1 : internet explorer 11 retirement impacts windows 8 phones users support for existing orgs to access the salesforce1 mobile browser app ( and lightning experience ) from microsoft internet explorer 11 ends december 16 , 2017 .
because internet explorer 11 is the only salesforce1-supported mobile browser for windows 8 phones , salesforce1 support for windows 8 phones will also end at the same time .
summer ’16 includes a critical update that allows orgs to get a head start on transitioning users away from internet explorer 11 .
if you have windows 8 phone users , we recommend that you define an upgrade plan for these users before you activate this critical update .
see retirement of support for accessing lightning experience and the salesforce1 mobile browser app using microsoft internet explorer version 11 for full details .
as a courtesy to your windows 8 phone users , when salesforce1 mobile browser app access via internet explorer 11 is disabled , attempts to log in to salesforce1 from internet explorer are redirected to salesforce classic .
however , salesforce does n’t support using salesforce classic in any mobile browser — including internet explorer 11 on windows 8 phones .
we recommend that your windows 8 phone users upgrade to windows 10 and the microsoft edge mobile browser , or another supported device and mobile browser combination , when feasible .
see requirements for the salesforce1 mobile app in the salesforce help for the full list of salesforce1-supported devices and browsers .

salesforce1 : display of reports in the salesforce1 for ios navigation menu for version 10.0 or later of the salesforce1 for ios downloadable app , the reports item in the salesforce1 navigation menu now behaves the same as in the other salesforce1 apps .
if you do n’t add reports directly to the navigation menu , the reports item is automatically included in the set of smart search items that users access from the recent section of the navigation menu .
salesforce1 : change a record ’s owner being out of the office is no longer a blocker if your sales professionals need to delegate records or reassign record ownership to keep your business processes moving forward .
salesforce1 users can now change record owners for accounts , campaigns , cases , contacts , leads , opportunities , work orders , and custom objects .
the new change owner action , accessible from the action bar , is available in all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .
the change owner action appears only if the user has permission to change record ownership .
and same as in the full salesforce site , a user can give ownership of a record to another user as long as the new owner has a minimum of “ read ” permission for the type of record being transferred .
see change a record ’s owner in the salesforce help for more details .

edit and delete actions in the action bar are available for cached records only .

record types for recent objects •
if your org has defined more than 15 record types for any of a user ’s recent objects ( that is , the first five objects listed in the recent section of the user ’s salesforce1 navigation menu ) , only the first 15 record types are available when creating a record offline .
and only records matching those 15 record types are editable while offline .
lookups and picklists • dependent lookups and picklists for a cached record are n't supported when offline , unless the user interacted with these elements before the record was cached .
• lookup filters are n't supported when offline .
users can enter the name of the related lookup record when editing data offline but the app does n’t search for related looked records until the user ’s mobile device is back online . •
complex page layouts , with a very large number of fields or many picklists , can result in records that are too large for salesforce1 to cache .
if a user does n’t see recently accessed records for an object when offline , this may be the reason why .
if this becomes a problem for your users , we recommend re - evaluating the affected object ’s page layout to see if you can optimize it for mobile use .
notes • notes that include images are n’t available offline . •
images ca n’t be added to notes when working offline . •
users ca n't relate notes to records when working offline .

obviously the condition of a network can affect how salesforce1 performs .
now , users can test current network conditions directly from the app .
this feature is available in the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios , version 10.0.1 or later .
if a user experiences issues with the latest salesforce1 for ios app , have him test his network so you can rule it out as the source of the problem .
to test a network , open the salesforce1 navigation menu , then select settings > test my network .
from here , users can test ping , download speed , and upload speed ( 1 ) .
here ’s what each test tells you about your user ’s network condition .
this test ... tells you ...
ping how long it takes for the app to send a request to salesforce and then get a reply .
in general , lower ping times are better than higher ones .
if there ’s no result at all , the network may not be connected to the internet .
results are reported in milliseconds .
download speed how long it takes the app to get data from salesforce .
in general , higher download speeds are better than lower ones .

salesforce1 : get enhanced security for salesforce1 for ios with mobile device management ( mdm ) are you concerned about users running salesforce1 on unapproved devices ?
are you fielding too many login problems from your mobile users ?
with the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios , version 10.0 or later , you can combine salesforce1 with a mobile device management suite and reap the benefits of enhanced security and a streamlined login process for your users .
you get control over the distribution of salesforce1 and over your users’ devices .
enhanced security functions include certificate - based authentication , automatic custom host provisioning , and the ability to clear a user ’s clipboard whenever salesforce1 is in the background .
( most of these options are also available for salesforce1 for android , as of version 9.0 . )
note :  saml 2.0 ( security assertion markup language ) must be enabled and configured for your organization .
to get started , the first step is to configure your mobile device management ( mdm ) suite .
there are several mdm solutions in the market place .
when you decide on the right product , work with your mdm provider to complete the configuration for your org .
when your mdm suite is up and running for your org , you ’re ready to implement the enhanced security features of the salesforce1 for ios app .
security options include : certificate - based authentication simplify salesforce1 provisioning and your day - to - day mobile administration tasks by eliminating the need for your users to enter usernames and passwords to access salesforce1 .
when you use mdm and x.509 identity certificates , your users can authenticate more efficiently .
or you can include a second factor in the login process .
you can also use your mdm suite to push the salesforce1 app to your users — guaranteeing that the app is getting installed on company - managed devices only .
automatic custom host provisioning reduce mobile login issues by automatically configuring the login hosts available in salesforce1 .
this spares your mobile users from needing to manually type long login host urls — typically a frustrating and error - prone activity .
and you can set up additional custom login hosts if you have users who access multiple salesforce orgs .
you can also lock down the list of login hosts that users can access , which prevents users from adding their own hosts .
( requires salesforce1 for ios version 10.0.2 or later . )
clear clipboard contents you can add an extra layer of security by clearing the contents of a mobile device ’s clipboard whenever salesforce1 is put into the background .
your users are probably copying and pasting sensitive data as a part of their day - to - day salesforce1 activities .
this enhancement ensures that any salesforce data that winds up on the clipboard ca n’t be used outside of salesforce1 .
to enable these options , configure key - value pair assignments through your mdm suite .
see the mdm chapter in the salesforce1 mobile security guide for full details . 230 salesforce summer ’16 release notes salesforce1 : news and insights , and continued productivity offline salesforce1 : downloadable apps
do n’t share authentication with in - app browsers the salesforce1 downloadable apps do n’t share authentication information with in - app browsers when accessing external urls — that is , urls that are outside the salesforce1 one.app  domain .
with version 10.0 or later of the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios , the in - app safari browser identifies itself with a unique user agent string and does n’t have access to cookies or other authentication information from salesforce1 .
navigation mechanisms that open external urls ( for example , visualforce pages or components that call sforce.one.navigatetosobject ( ) ) , usually result in the user needing to log in again from the in - app browser to see the page .
the in - app browser in pre-10.0 versions of salesforce1 for ios did n’t enforce the need for re - authentication .
salesforce1 : new color palette for salesforce1 for ios the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios , version 10.0 introduces a new color palette that provides a consistent look and feel with lightning experience .
salesforce1 for ios now uses white and cool - toned grays , injected with a hint of salesforce blue , to create a lively and modern mood .
the sparing use of color helps keep your content center stage and eliminates visual distractions for your users .
( this new color palette is also used in salesforce1 for android , version 9.0 or later but is n’t yet available in the salesforce1 mobile browser app . )
custom branding of salesforce1 for ios is still supported and any custom branding that you ’ve already applied is still there for your ios users after they upgrade to version 10.0 .
if your org hasn’t already added its own unique stamp to salesforce1 , the new , neutral background of the mobile app gives you a great canvas from which to highlight your company ’s brand .
231 salesforce summer ’16 release notes salesforce1 : news and insights , and continued productivity offline salesforce1 : copy and paste text on record detail pages typing on mobile keywords can be error - prone and frustrating .
so any time users can copy from existing data instead of typing , it ’s a good thing .
salesforce1 now includes support for the standard android and ios copy , cut , and paste gestures when viewing , creating , and editing record details .
for example , a sales rep can copy field values from an account detail page and paste the values to fields when editing a contact or creating an opportunity . pasting copied data
is supported on edit pages and when using create and update quick actions .
this feature is available in all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .
salesforce1 : we ’ve switched to ios and android date and time selectors we ’ve replaced the original salesforce1 date and time selectors with the date and time selectors provided by android and ios .
so now android users work with the interface they ’re used to , ios users work with the interface they ’re used to , and no one has to keep track of another interface .
this change applies to all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app when run on ios and android devices .
the os - specific selectors appear when interacting with fields that require date or time values , such as when setting a due date on a task , start and end dates on an event , or the close date on an opportunity .
salesforce1 : close popup windows like in lightning experience to better align the salesforce mobile experience with the lightning experience interface , salesforce1 users now close popup windows by tapping cancel instead of an x icon in the upper - right corner of the window .
this change appears in all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .
salesforce1 : see more record data without scrolling we rearranged and shortened the highlights area on record detail pages so salesforce1 users see more data without scrolling .
this feature is available in all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .

community members now see search results based on objects they can access ( including custom ones ! ) , as long as they ’re searchable .
other enhancements include improvements when searching for person accounts .
we ’ve made quite a few improvements to the search publisher component , so you can make the following customizations : 246 salesforce summer ’16 release notes community templates • as members enter search items , the search publisher has the option of showing suggested results in one list , rather than tabbed articles and discussions lists .
want to keep the tabbed lists ?
no worries , you can definitely keep them . ( 1 ) • want to turn off autocomplete ?
not sure why you would , but now you can . •
want to hide the footer that allows community members to ask a question or contact support ?
you now have the option of showing the footer or not , based on your community ’s needs .
previously , the footer was always on by default .
( 2 ) • before this release , when members were on a topic detail page and started entering a search term , the search was only limited to the topic .
now the search is done across the community , and the member has the option of only limiting it to the topic if needed .
example :  global search results shown in the community .
the global search results component is the newest lightning component in the community builder .
with this component , members can see search results in one tab ( all ) , and cases , accounts , contacts , and any other object exposed in the community to which they have access .
( 1 ) community managers can easily determine which tabs , and thus which search results , they want community members to see .
important :  to allow your users to find a custom object ’s records when they search , in salesforce setup create a custom tab set to default on  or default off .
creating a custom tab enables the custom object 's allow search setting .
do more with topics add the featured topics component on any page , translate topic names and descriptions , easily filter articles without topics in community management , and more .

it is also available as a standalone component for use on other parts of the page ( 2 ) .
translate topic names and descriptions for communities with a global audience ( generally available ) use the translation workbench to translate topic descriptions and navigational and featured topics in communities with a global audience .
consider the following when using the translation workbench . •
there is no metadata api support for translated topic names or descriptions . •
while topic name uniqueness is guaranteed in english , the translator must ensure the uniqueness of topic names in the translated language .
• modifying topic names from community management only changes the english community .
all translated topic name and description changes must be made using the translation workbench . •
if a translated topic name is entered when the community is in english mode , the translated name can appear twice in the translated community .
249 salesforce summer ’16 release notes community templates •
when topics names are translated with the translation workbench , hashtags in the translated communities also change .
for example , # help shows as # aiuto in italian .
if the community member then reverts to english from italian , clicking the # aiuto hashtag gives an error message rather than showing the topic detail page of # help .

who sees what with profile - based page visibility create page variations that target specific audiences in your napili community , and control who sees what depending on their profile .
you ’ve been able to create alternative versions of a page for several releases , but you could make only one the active or visible page .
now , with profile - based page visibility , you can make as many page variations visible as you like ! note :  for communities using the winter ’16 and later versions of the napili template , this functionality is available immediately after the summer ’16 release . let ’s say you have a financial services community and you want your clients and your brokers to see a different home page based on their profile .
you can create two variations of the home page , each with content targeting a specific audience —
clients and brokers in this case — and set the visibility of each page to different profiles .
all members go to the same url , but clients see home a , whereas brokers see home b.
who exactly sees what
? all this magic happens in the page manager area , where we ’ve added a page variations tab for each page .
choose from three visibility options that , when combined with a page ’s published status , determine whether a page is visible to community members .
default : all users unless set by profile when the page is published , it ’s visible to all valid community members , except members whose profiles are assigned to a different page variation .
one default variation is required .
by profile when the page is published , it ’s visible only to users with the selected profiles .
none even if the page is published , it ’s not visible to users .
example :  here are several home page variations with differing visibility and published statuses .
• home a is visible only to profile a members . • home b is visible only to profile b members , but they ca n’t see pending changes . •
home c is n’t visible . •
home d is visible to all members , except profile a or profile b members . •
home e is n’t visible .
257 salesforce summer ’16 release notes community builder note :  a page variation that was previously set as the active page is now set to default visibility .
the visibility of all other page variations is set to none .
if the page was previously published , that status is applied to all its page variations .
however , a published page variation with visibility set to none is never visible to your community members .
we ’ve made quite a few changes to the page manager area to accommodate profile - based page visibility .
but there ’s more to see , so ramble over to the enhanced page manager to learn more .

you ’ve read about profile - based page visibility , right ?
( if not , get on it ! )
so you know we ’ve made some significant changes to the page manager area as a result .
as part of these enhancements , we ’ve made page manager more intuitive and consistent by : • adding quick find ( 1 ) •
moving the option to create and manage page variations to a separate page variations tab ( 2 ) note :
all pages can now have page variations , including the home and error pages .
if you previously created custom home or error pages , they appear in that page ’s page variations tab . •
removing the active page property because now you can make any page variation visible in napili • including visibility and status columns ( 3 ) so that you can tell at a glance which variations are live • adding the ability to duplicate page variations — no more starting from scratch ! ( 4 ) • providing options to manage page visibility in napili ( 4 ) • relocating the pages associated with an object to the page menu ( 5 ) 258 salesforce summer ’16 release notes community builder leverage lightning design tokens to brand custom components psst !

in communities that use a salesforce tabs + visualforce template , posts in pending review status are displayed the same as regular posts ( pending review is n’t displayed ) , and users with the “
can approve feed post ”
permission do n’t see the approve action .
important :  members in a community with a salesforce tabs + visualforce template ca n't see that their post is awaiting approval .
however , they do receive an email when the post is approved . •
the feed compact component does n’t display pending review in the header of a post that is pending approval . •
you ca n’t review or approve posts in private and unlisted groups , unless you are a member of the group . •
after a post is approved , it ca n’t be sent for review again . •

if a member attaches a file to a post sent for approval , the file is published .
even though the post is n’t visible in the general community feed , the file is visible .
the file appears in the list of group files and in related lists .
example :  here are some of the ways you can use rules to review member - generated content .

limiting rules rate rules monitor and limit how frequently member - generated content is created in your community .
rate rules protect your community against spammers and bots that attack your community by posting the same message multiple times in a row .
you can create rate rules to notify your moderators of suspicious spammer - like behavior or freeze a member on the spot .
what ’s a rate rule ?
the easiest way to explain is to fill in the blanks : when a member creates content _
_  times in _ _  minutes , i want to notify community moderators .
when a member creates content _ _  times in _
_  minutes , i want to freeze the member .
a rate limit determines how much content a member can create in your community in a specific time frame .
each rate rule specifies which types of member - generated content the rule applies to ( such as posts and comments ) , the time frame ( either 3 minutes or 15 minutes ) , and the amount of content that triggers the action .
there are two actions : notification and freeze .
you can set up your rate rule for both actions or just one .
you can apply the rule to posts , comments , files , and private messages .
tip :
set up member criteria for even more specialized protection against spammers !
member criteria targets specific groups of members based on their user profile , user type , user creation date , or whether they 've successfully posted or commented in the community before .
moderators receive an email for both actions because they need to know when the rate limit is reached and when a member is frozen .
emails are sent to users with the “ moderate community users ” permission .
make sure that you assign your moderators this permission .
emails are sent even if a user has turned off chatter emails .
how do i set up rate rules ?
before creating your rate rule , keep these things in mind . • rate rules do n’t apply to internal users .
you can use member criteria that includes internal users , but the rules just do n’t apply to them . •
when members are frozen , they ’re frozen in all communities they ’re a member of .
• make sure that you set up appropriate member criteria to use in your rate rule .
for example , let 's say you have a rate rule that uses member criteria to filter for members without community contributions .
after a members first post or comment , the rule does n’t apply to the member anymore , so the member does n’t reach the freeze limit you set .
you can create and manage rate rules in community management under moderation > rules .
264 salesforce summer ’16 release notes community management example :  let ’s use the following rate rule as an example .
applies to : posts and private messages member criteria : customer users created in the past 7 days content creation time frame : 3 minutes notify moderators : 6 freeze members : 10 with this rate rule , here ’s what happens when a member reaches your limits .
in the span of 3 minutes , a member creates ... is the moderator notified ?
is the member frozen ? 4 posts and 2 private messages 6 posts 6 comments 8 posts and 2 private messages 10 posts 10 comments 265 salesforce summer ’16 release notes
community management a rate rule like this protects the community from spammers and bots but also allows you to help your new members .
maybe a non - threatening member posted a question over and over hoping to get it answered faster .
rate rules do more than protect —
they help you reach out to members in need .
here ’s a rule set up just for private messages .
applies to : private messages member criteria : customer users created in the past 3 days content creation time frame : 15 minutes notify moderators : 1 freeze members : 3 this rate rule protects the community from spammers that attack via private messages .
in the past , private message attacks were hard to detect and triage because they were n’t visible in the community .
worry no more : rate rules solve this problem .
if your rate rule is reached , your moderators receive an email .
a moderator can unfreeze members from their profile or through community management .
tip :  install the salesforce communities management package from the appexchange to get the new frozen members insights report .

salesforce help : create member criteria to moderate your community ( can be outdated or unavailable during release preview ) manage problem members with freeze community moderators can freeze troublesome community members .
freezing members prevents them from logging in to any community or even salesforce itself , thwarting their nefarious plans .
who can freeze members depends on a couple things .
users with the " moderate community users " or " manage users " permission can freeze external members on their user profile page or in community management .
users with the " manage users " permission can freeze internal users in community management .
to freeze a member from their profile page , a moderator simply clicks the freeze button .
although a frozen member ’s profile is still visible , that person ca n’t log in , let alone post .
to unfreeze a member , go back to their profile and click the unfreeze button .
note :  in napili aura templates , the freeze action is only available in versions 35 and higher .
the freeze button appears on external users profiles .
to freeze a member in community management , use the new members insights report .
example :  the freeze button on a member ’s profile page .
find everything about community moderation in one place
we 've made life easier for your community managers by putting the moderation setup and managing tasks in one place .
we moved the moderation insights reports from the insights section to the moderation section in community management .
we also removed the flagged files and flagged posts pages from the moderation section .
these pages displayed a list of flagged files and posts to users with special permissions .
instead , you use the moderation insights reports to manage flagged files and posts .
insights reports are more powerful than the old pages , and your community managers will love the increase in their efficiency . 268 salesforce summer ’16 release notes community management

moderate private messages in your community when your members flag an inappropriate message , your moderators can use community management to review the message —
they can even see its contents !
moderators can then use an insights report to remove the flag or delete the message .
to view flagged private messages , moderators and managers need the “
moderate communities chatter messages ” permission .
moderators see the contents of private messages only in communities they ’re a member of .
previously , to moderate flagged private messages , you had to use the api and assign your users the “ manage chatter messages ” permission .
this permission gave users access to all private messages in your internal salesforce org .
yikes !
so if you previously assigned your moderators the “ manage chatter messages ” permission , replace it with the “
moderate communities chatter messages ” permission . 269 salesforce

but do n’t worry , we ’ve got you covered there , too !
tip :  install the salesforce communities management package available on the appexchange shortly after the summer ’16 release .
this package provides preconfigured insights reports that work with our preset actions .
if you previously installed the salesforce communities management package , you see actions for the report .
each insights report has different actions .
from the insights report , click actions at any time , but keep in mind that an insights report must have at least one action . to edit the actions assigned to the report .
you can edit these 271 salesforce summer ’16 release notes community insights actions that appear on the insights report are displayed based on the data returned in the report .
for example , if the report returns data about a user , the freeze member and unfreeze member actions are displayed .
if the report stops returning data , actions are n’t removed .
however , when you go to the edit insights actions page , we let you know which actions are no longer appropriate .
actions that appear on the edit insights actions page are all the available and appropriate actions for your report .
this same logic is used to display custom actions .
so how do we make this magic happen ?
visualforce pages drive insights actions .
let ’s look at the freeze member action as an example .
this action appears when the report returns data about a user .
behind the scenes , a visualforce page for this action links to the user object using a standard controller .
when your report returns data about a user , all visualforce pages related to the user object display in the list of available insights actions .
to create your own custom action , use a visualforce page .
for example , you can create a custom action to delete all activity for a member .
if a spammer attacks your community , use this custom action to remove all the spammer ’s posts and comments with one click !
talk about power !

are you one of those cool people who likes to keep up on what ’s trending ?
do you want to know what people are talking about and knowledgeable about ?
then you probably know about the power of topics .
you add them to your accounts , leads , and other records . 294 salesforce summer ’16 release notes make files more visible with topics or you might add them to your chatter feed posts .
in a sea of information , topics bring organization and visibility to help you find what you ’re looking for .
when searching for a topic , you ’ll see all the records it ’s assigned to .
this now includes….wait for it….files !
how , you ask ?
there are two ways : • in chatter feeds , simply add topics to questions or posts that contain files .
they ’ll get added to those files . •
for developers , add topics to files with chatter rest api and soap api .
topics for files are enabled by default on the topics for object settings page in setup , under the object name content document .
from there , you can select fields to use for topic suggestions .
to find files and everything else that ’s associated with a particular topic , click on the topic in a feed , or go to chatter > topics .
find the topic you want , go to the records tab , and select files ( or the feed tab if the topic is n’t associated with any records other than files ) .
in salesforce1 , there ’s no records tab , but you can view the topic ’s posts and files when you tap on a topic .
295 salesforce summer ’16 release notes toggle between " viewer " and " set by record " file access toggle
between " viewer " and " set by record " file access files attached to records now have a new way to set access via sharing settings .
instead of being limited to viewer access only , you can set access to set by record .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
we introduced the set by record file sharing status via api only in spring ’16 .
now , a toggle is available in the sharing settings interface in salesforce classic .
users who have access to a file via a record it ’s attached to can now have their access set at the record level .
when access is set to set by record , users with view access to the record also have view access to the file ; and those who can edit the record can also edit the file .
if you have at least collaborator access to the file and any access to the record , you can change this setting again at any time in the file sharing settings .
just look for the record name , and change the access level to viewer or set by record .
why is this helpful ?
because it lets you grant edit access to a file to those who have read / write access on the record it ’s attached to .
example :  let ’s say you ’ve attached the file sales_training.pptx to an account .
you want bruno mars to be able to edit the account and the file , so you give him read / write access to the account .
by default , account and other records grant only viewer access to the files attached to them .
previously , you could only change this viewer access via api .
now you can toggle to set by record in sharing settings , which lets bruno edit not just the record but that sales training deck .
delete files included in content packs file owners can now delete a file without having to first remove it from a content pack , which saves time and streamlines file management . deleting a file from salesforce removes all versions of that file from all content packs , including content packs the user does n’t have access to , like those in private libraries .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
the file owner and users with delete permission can delete files .
admins can enable this setting from the salesforce crm content settings page in setup .
the setting is disabled by default .
browse external files from files home in lightning experience the files connect functionality you love in salesforce classic is now available in lightning experience .
you can browse your external sources from files home , where you can open , share , and download external files and file references .
select the external data source from the left navigation of files home .
on the right is a list of external files .
you can open , share , and download these files from the row - level action or from the file preview .
296 salesforce summer ’16 release notes connect to box from salesforce ( generally available ) when you share an external file , a file reference is created .
in lightning experience , only one file reference is created for an external file , preventing duplicates .
deleting a file reference removes the file reference from salesforce , but does n’t delete the file in the external source .

you define the list of values for a picklist when you create the custom picklist field .
to enable validation of picklist values against the defined list of values , select strictly enforce picklist values .
this setting prevents users from adding values through the api .
if you do n’t select strictly enforce picklist values , a picklist value that 's not part of the picklist definition can be saved to a record via the api , reducing the cleanliness of your data .
here ’s another reason to try restricted picklists : you can use them in custom metadata types .
custom metadata types are custom - defined types of application metadata that can be packaged and used along with an app .
they save time by letting you define configurations and create reusable app components and features .
picklists on custom metadata types are always restricted , so enable restricted picklists to use custom metadata types .

legacy data import tools to retire in february 2017 if you still use the individual import wizards for accounts , contacts , leads , person accounts , solutions , and custom objects , start using the data import wizard instead .
in spring , these import tools will no longer be available .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
for now , you can still access the legacy data import tools from the data import wizard page .
from setup , enter data import wizard  in the quick find  box , then select data import wizard .
then click legacy data import tools .
we ’ve added reminders throughout the legacy data import wizard pages that they will be unavailable in february 2017 .
use the legacy data import tools only when needed as your org transitions to the data import wizard .
you can suggest and vote on enhancements to the data import wizard on the ideaexchange .
the data import wizard behaves differently from the legacy data import tools , so confirm that your users have the required permissions and educate your users .
for example , csv files that work with the legacy data import tools do n’t always work with the data import wizard .
the data import wizard sometimes requires more fields in the import file to ensure the data completeness of records in your 323 salesforce summer ’16 release notes data import salesforce org .
also , unlike some legacy data import tools , the data import wizard ca n’t import contacts , leads , and person accounts in the same import file .

how - to series salesforce help : importing records data import wizard enhancements for matching by external id for any object , you can specify an external id field for the data import wizard to find existing records that match the import data .
if your import is adding only new records , the data import wizard ignores the import file rows that contain matching values for the external id field .
if your import is updating existing records , the data import wizard uses the import file ’s data to update the matching records in salesforce .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
previously , matching by external id was available only when importing solutions or custom objects .
now the option is available regardless for which object you ’re importing records .
if the object has multiple external id fields , you can now specify which field to match by .
previously , the data import wizard made that decision for you .
an external id is a custom field that has the external id attribute , meaning that it contains unique record identifiers from a system outside of salesforce .
when you select this option , the data import wizard detects existing records in salesforce with external ids that match those in the import file .
this operation is not case - sensitive .
for example , “
abc ” is matched with “
abc ” .
however , if the external id field also has the case - sensitive unique attribute , uppercase and lowercase letters are n’t considered identical .

in addition to some generally available enhancements , like how we treat percentage values , we ’re rolling out two awesome pilots !
one to add flows to any lightning page , and another to build your own flow run time experience .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .

again ( critical update ) have you added special calculations to your flow to get the right output for a percent field ?
this critical update lets you remove those workarounds .
access cross - object owner fields in flow some fields have relationships to more than one object .
we call these relationships polymorphic .
for example , if you have queues enabled for cases , a case owner can be either a user or queue .
if you ’re traversing from a case to its owner id , add special syntax to identify which object you mean when you say “
owner ” .
give your lightning experience and salesforce1 users the power of flows ( pilot ) the day is finally here !
we ’re rolling out a flow component for the lightning app builder .
you can now add flows to any lightning page – app pages , record pages , and home pages alike .

trust percent values in flow sobject variables
again ( critical update ) have you added special calculations to your flow to get the right output for a percent field ?
this critical update lets you remove those workarounds .
previously , our calculations on percent values were n’t always working as expected .
we rolled out a partial fix last release .
this release we ’re rolling out the rest of the fix as a critical update .
why ?
we know that many of you have workarounds in place to make sure the flow calculates correctly .
because our change makes those workarounds unnecessary , here ’s your chance to test how the current state of percent calculations works for your flows .
here ’s how you can expect percent values to behave after you activate this critical update .
325 salesforce summer ’16 release notes visual workflow when you ...
the value ...
example pass a numerical value into an sobject variable ’s percent field does n’t change 100 remains 100 .
when you save this value to a new or existing record , the percent value is 100% .
pass the value of one sobject variable ’s percent field into the percent field of another sobject variable does n’t change 100 remains 100 .
when you save this value to a new or existing record , the percent value is 100% .
reference an sobject variable ’s percent field into a formula1 divides by 100 100 becomes 1 .
when you save this value to a new or existing record , the percent value is 1% .
1if you ’re saving this value to a new or existing salesforce record , we recommend multiplying it by 100 .
as always , test various permutations of your flow to make sure that the calculations are working correctly .
test this critical update we recommend testing the critical update in a sandbox .
if you must work in your production org , do so during off - peak hours . 1 .
identify the flows that deal with percent fields in sobject variables . 2 .
activate this critical update .
3 .
in your flows , identify any workarounds that you added to control how percent values were being calculated and adjust them for the new behavior .
the recommended workaround was to multiply the sobject percent field values by 100 .
4 . test each flow to make sure that the results with the critical update are correct .
access cross - object owner fields in flow some fields have relationships to more than one object .
we call these relationships polymorphic .
for example , if you have queues enabled for cases , a case owner can be either a user or queue .
if you ’re traversing from a case to its owner id , add special syntax to identify which object you mean when you say “
owner ” .
to reference a field on a related record , use this syntax . { !
sobjectvariable.polymorphicobjectname1:specificobjectname2.fieldname } where : • sobjectvariable  is the unique name for the sobject variable that you want to start from . •
polymorphicobject  is the api name for a polymorphic relationship for sobjectvariable 's object type . •
specificobjectname  is the api name for the object that you want to select from the polymorphic relationship . •
fieldname  is the name for the field that you want to reference on the last object in the expression .
all custom field api names end in _ _ c .
supported relationships not every relationship is polymorphic , so we recommend using the polymorphic syntax only when you know that the field can link to multiple objects .
the following relationships are supported . •
case .
source • feeditem .
createdby • object .
owner 326 salesforce summer ’16 release notes visual workflow where object lets you set owner to either a user or a queue .
group .
owner  and queue .
owner  are n’t supported .
example :  { ! sobj_case .
owner : user .
id }  references the id of the user who owns the case , while { ! sobj_case .
owner : queue .
id }  references the id of the queue who owns the case .
you can always add the polymorphic reference after several traversals ( { ! sobj_case .
account .
owner : user .
id } ) or in the middle of a reference ( { ! sobj_case .
owner : user .
manager .
id } ) .
give your lightning experience and salesforce1 users the power of flows ( pilot ) the day is finally here !
we ’re rolling out a flow component for the lightning app builder .
you can now add flows to any lightning page – app pages , record pages , and home pages alike .
note :  we provide the flow lightning component to selected customers through a pilot program that requires agreement to specific terms and conditions .
to be nominated to participate in the program , contact salesforce .
pilot programs are subject to change , and we ca n’t guarantee acceptance .
the flow lightning component is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
we ca n’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all .
make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available products and features .
you can provide feedback and suggestions for the flow lightning component in the ideaexchange .
when you ’re in the pilot , you can add the flow component to your lightning pages just like any other component .
your flow might need the id of the record that it ’s operating on , but do n’t worry !
record pages send the id to your flow automatically if you have the correct text input variable configured .
example :  here ’s how a flow called survey customers appears when embedded in a record page in lightning experience and an app page in salesforce1 .

previously , the session id could be used in the api and was eligible for validity extensions .
to disable this feature , contact salesforce .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
new x_readonlymode parameter in oauth 2.0
responses users have read - only access to salesforce during splits , instance migrations , instance switches , and other maintenance events .

no longer supported we ’re changing our endpoint routing to deliver better performance and higher availability for our dedicated user interface login endpoints .
previously , you could use www.salesforce.com/login.jsp as a user interface login endpoint , which then routed you to the correct login instance .
as of june 25 , 2016 , we are removing internal routing , and you have to change your user interface login endpoints from www.salesforce.com/login.jsp to https://login.salesforce.com/login.jsp .
this change applies only to user interface login traffic .
logging in from a browser by clicking login still works .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
identity verification labels and email are easier to understand to reflect recent enhancements to our identity verification procedures , we ’ve changed some labels in the user interface and slightly revised an email your users get when verifying their identity .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
log in even faster with the salesforce authenticator app
now you can approve tasks directly from your mobile phone notifications .
no more drilling into the app to approve automated tasks .
apple watch also syncs to the app more quickly so you do n’t have to wait for your codes to appear .

salesforce authenticator works for lightning experience , salesforce classic , and the salesforce mobile app .
save the day by generating a temporary verification code for users in distress generate a temporary identity verification code for users who forgot , lost , or otherwise ca n’t access the device they usually use for two - factor authentication .
the user can log in and stay productive , and you do n’t have to weaken security for your salesforce org or community by removing the two - factor authentication requirement .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
editions available in : contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions for communities , set up this feature in the parent salesforce org .
communities is only supported in salesforce classic .
for example , a user who gets a verification code from an app on a mobile phone leaves the phone at home one day .
you give the user a temporary code that is valid for only eight hours .
the next day , the user returns to work with the phone and gets a verification code from the mobile app as usual .
important :  if your org has implemented a two - factor authentication policy , temporary identity verification codes can be used to satisfy two - factor authentication requirements .
temporary codes can not be used for device activations .
that is , when users log in from an unrecognized browser or app and we require identity verification , they ca n’t use a temporary code . salesforce admins and non - admin users with the “ manage two - factor authentication in user interface ” permission can generate temporary verification codes .
to get a code , go to the user ’s advanced user details page .
find temporary verification code , and click generate .
if you do n’t already have a session with high - assurance security , you must verify your identity before you can complete the code generation .
verifying your identity ensures that only authorized users can generate a temporary verification code .
when salesforce displays the code , give it to your user right away .
after you return to the user ’s detail page , you ca n’t see the code again .
the code can be used multiple times until it expires .
it ’s valid only when entered in an identity verification screen that asks for a temporary verification code .
note :  when you add an identity verification method to a user ’s account by generating a temporary verification code , the user gets an email .
to stop sending emails to users when identity verification methods are added to their accounts , contact salesforce .
to remove a code before its expiration time , click expire now on the user ’s advanced user details page .

a modern and intelligent user experience delegate two - factor authentication management tasks a new permission lets you delegate some two - factor authentication support tasks to users who are n’t salesforce admins .
all users with the “ manage users ” permission also have the new permission , and you ca n’t remove it from those users .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
users with the “ manage two - factor authentication in user interface ” permission can : • generate temporary verification codes for users who ca n’t access the device they usually use for two - factor authentication . •
disconnect identity verification methods from user accounts when a user loses or replaces a device .

• view the identity verification methods report by clicking a link on the identity verification history page .
• create user list views that show which identity verification methods users have registered .
some actions require users to first establish a session with high - assurance security , usually by completing two - factor authentication .
you can assign the new permission to users who do n’t have the “
manage users ” permission .
for example , assign the permission to your company ’s internal support staff .
example :  you assign the new permission to members of your company ’s employee help desk .
one of your users , inder , calls the help desk on friday to report that his company - issued mobile phone is broken .
inder usually completes two - factor authentication by responding to a push notification on his phone using the salesforce authenticator mobile app .
because his phone does n’t power up , he ca n’t access the app .
kimi , a help desk staff member , checks inder ’s employee badge to verify his identity and generates a temporary code for him .
she sets the code to be valid for eight hours .
each time inder logs in on friday , he uses the code instead of responding to a salesforce authenticator push notification .
he also submits his phone to the help desk for repairs .
on monday , kimi tells inder that she has to issue him a new phone because his old one could n’t be fixed .
before she gives inder the new phone , she navigates to his user detail page , finds app registration : salesforce authenticator , and clicks disconnect .
salesforce authenticator also generates one - time passwords , so she clicks disconnect next to app registration : one - time password generator .
now when inder installs salesforce authenticator on his new phone , he can connect the app to his salesforce account again .
after connecting the app , he can use it for two - factor authentication , just like he did before his old phone broke .

track tls protocol and cipher suite data for user logins prepare for salesforce ’s disablement of the tls 1.0 encryption protocol by tracking which protocol and cipher suite your users use when they log in .
when you create a login history list view in setup or run a report that includes login data , add the tls protocol and tls cipher suite fields .
in login history , you can also download a csv file that lists only those logins that used the tls 1.0 protocol .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
editions available in all editions in views , reports , and downloadable csv files , the tls protocol and tls cipher suite fields are populated for summer ’16 logins and later .

set the page title in lightning experience with the < apex : page > title attribute
in prior releases of lightning experience setting the page title of a visualforce page had no effect .
with this release , you can set the page ’s title using the title attribute of the < apex : page >  tag .
this sets the text used in browser windows , tabs , and bookmarks , and makes using lightning experience in multiple tabs a better experience .
control scroll - based zooming in visualforce maps use the scollbasedzooming attribute of the < apex : map >  tag to control whether maps can be zoomed using a scroll wheel or touch - based controls .
setting scollbasedzooming  to false  prevents accidental map zooming , especially on touch - based devices such as the apple magic mouse or logitech m600 mouse .
fix for rendering quirks when svg namespace added to page in previous releases , if you added an svg graphic to a visualforce , and the markup for that graphic included an xmlns  attribute referencing the namespace for svg xml , it caused significant issues when rendering the page .
we ’ve fixed the underlying issue .
disable custom doctypes in visualforce markup ( critical update )
this critical update changes the rules for visualforce markup to no longer allow the use of custom doctypes .
“ pagereference getcontent ( ) and getcontentaspdf ( ) methods behave as callouts ”
critical update postponed in summer ’15 , we changed the behavior of the getcontent ( )  and getcontentaspdf ( )  methods of the pagereference object .
this change was released as a critical update named “ pagereference getcontent ( ) and getcontentaspdf ( ) methods behave as callouts ” and was scheduled for auto - activation in summer ’16 .
the auto - activation date has been postponed until winter .
visualforce for lightning experience is generally available with this release , visualforce is fully supported in lightning experience .
365 salesforce summer ’16 release notes visualforce does this mean that every feature of visualforce is available in lightning experience ?
in a word , no .
there remain a number of behavior differences that are due to intrinsic differences between lightning experience and salesforce classic .
we do n’t expect these to go away , but we do expect them to evolve as lightning experience matures .
keep your eyes on this channel .
for a summary of visualforce for lightning experience differences , see what ’s not available in summer ‘
16 lightning experience features elsewhere in the release notes .
to get started creating apps for lightning experience with the full details , see the lightning experience development trail on trailhead .

salesforce help : what ’s not available in lightning experience trailhead : visualforce & lightning experience set the page title in lightning experience with the < apex : page > title attribute in prior releases of lightning experience setting the page title of a visualforce page had no effect .
with this release , you can set the page ’s title using the title attribute of the < apex : page >  tag .
this sets the text used in browser windows , tabs , and bookmarks , and makes using lightning experience in multiple tabs a better experience .
you can also set a visualforce page title by adding a static < title >  html tag to your page .
although using the page ’s title attribute is usually preferred , the treatment of the page title is the same .
finally , while it ’s not a primary use case , setting the page ’s title , using either technique , also affects the page in the salesforce1 mobile browser app .
the page ’s title appears in the history stack , and in browser tabs or windows .
the page title does n’t appear in the salesforce1 downloadable app .
control scroll - based zooming in visualforce maps use the scollbasedzooming attribute of the < apex : map >  tag to control whether maps can be zoomed using a scroll wheel or touch - based controls .
setting scollbasedzooming  to false  prevents accidental map zooming , especially on touch - based devices such as the apple magic mouse or logitech m600 mouse .
especially on the apple magic mouse , the twitchy , seemingly random map zooming could be maddening .
disabling scollbasedzooming  might save your users’ sanity .
fix for rendering quirks when svg namespace added to page in previous releases , if you added an svg graphic to a visualforce , and the markup for that graphic included an xmlns  attribute referencing the namespace for svg xml , it caused significant issues when rendering the page .
we ’ve fixed the underlying issue .
specifically , you would have encountered this issue when you added markup to a page that looked like the following .
< svg ... xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg " ... > the resulting rendering issues could take various forms , but none of them produced desirable results .
this issue has become especially acute with the release of the salesforce lightning design system ( slds ) , which uses svg graphics for many user interface elements .
since the reception for slds has been ... enthusiastic , we wanted to get this stumbling block out of your way .
disable custom doctypes in visualforce markup ( critical update )
this critical update changes the rules for visualforce markup to no longer allow the use of custom doctypes .
366 salesforce summer ’16 release notes apex code when this critical update is enabled , you ca n’t use custom doctypes in visualforce markup .
this update applies to extending the xml allowed in visualforce markup by declaring a custom doctype using the < !
doctype mydoctype [ ... ] > pattern .
custom doctypes were never documented or supported .
eliminating them allows visualforce processing to be simplified and optimized .
note :  this update does n’t apply to the documented and supported method of changing the page ’s declared doctype using the doctype  attribute of the < apex : page >  tag .
we recommend that you test this update in a sandbox or developer edition org to verify correct behavior of your visualforce pages before enabling it in your production org .
to activate this critical update : 1 .
from setup , enter critical updates  in the quick find  box , and then select critical updates .
2 . click activate for “ disable custom doctypes in visualforce markup ” . “
pagereference getcontent ( ) and getcontentaspdf ( ) methods behave as callouts ”
critical update postponed in summer ’15 , we changed the behavior of the getcontent ( )  and getcontentaspdf ( )  methods of the pagereference object .
this change was released as a critical update named “ pagereference getcontent ( ) and getcontentaspdf ( ) methods behave as callouts ” and was scheduled for auto - activation in summer ’16 .
the auto - activation date has been postponed until winter .

we ’ve also upgraded functionality related to connected apps , cors access , asynchronous callouts , and serialization .
for detailed information on these enhancements , refer to the apex developer guide .
in
this section : editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , developer , and database.com editions increased cross - namespace limits good news !
we ’ve increased the number of unique , certified namespaces that can be invoked during a single apex transaction .
take more control over your connected apps with the enhanced connected app plug - in we ’ve extended the apex connectedappplugin  class to give you more control over how your salesforce connected app is invoked .
with the apex invocationcontext enum , you can tell which authentication protocol is invoking the connected app .
you can use the modifysamlresponse  method to modify the saml xml request before the salesforce idp verifies and passes the certificate to the target service provider .
367 salesforce summer ’16 release notes apex code provision your connected apps with confidence provisioning users for your connected app is key to its adoption .
until now , it ’s been a challenge to test and manage the user provisioning process .
but that ’s changed with the new test utility class for writing automated tests .
use the testconnectorutil class to write automated tests that simulate user provisioning .
invoke the createconnectedapp  method within an apex test to create an instance of your connected app .
for managing the provisioning process , we ’ve extended the userprovisioningrequest  object to better handle provisioning failures .
view apex test results
more easily the new apex test history page shows all the test results associated with a test run .
the page shows results only for tests that have been run asynchronously .
this feature is available in lightning experience only .
configure your apex test runs
more easily in the tooling api
the tooling api ’s runtestsasynchronous ( )  soap call and /runtestsasynchronous/  rest resource now take a testlevel  parameter .
providing a testlevel  enum value of runspecifiedtests , runlocaltests , or runalltestsinorg lets you quickly and easily set up test runs .
this parameter is required in the soap call , although its value can be null .
for the rest resource , the new parameter is optional .
run soql queries on platformaction with a limit clause when you run a soql query in apex without a limit clause , a limit is added to the query .
however , queries on the platformaction object that contained a limit clause were being rejected , so we removed the limit clause restriction on platformaction queries .
you can now successfully run a soql query containing a limit clause on the platformaction object in apex .
simplify development of asynchronous callouts by using named credentials you can now use named credentials in long - running asynchronous callouts from a visualforce page ’s controller .
a named credential specifies the url of a callout endpoint and its required authentication parameters in one definition .
salesforce manages all authentication for callouts that specify a named credential as the callout endpoint so that your apex code does n’t have to .
you can also skip remote site settings , which are otherwise required for callouts to external sites , for the site defined in the named credential .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
suppress null values when serializing apex objects the current implementation of the apex serialize  method returns null  values when serializing apex objects into json .
now we ’ve added a serialize  method with a flag to suppress null  values .
set suppressapexobjectnulls  to true to suppress them when serializing apex objects into json .
use cors to access apex rest classes cors ( cross - origin resource sharing ) is a w3c recommendation that enables web browsers to request resources from origins other than their own ( cross - origin requests ) .
for example , using cors , a javascript script at https://www.example.com  can request a resource from https://www.salesforce.com .
apex rest now supports cors .
view skeleton code for global apex classes in installed managed packages you can now view skeleton code that includes the global constructors , methods , variables , and properties for global apex classes in the managed packages you ’ve installed in your org .
formerly , when you viewed these classes in setup you saw their constructor and method signatures , but in other development environments you saw only ( hidden ) .

in this release , you can include a code block in your feed posts , get article recommendations , and more .
increased non - selective query limits we ’ve increased the apex non - selective query limit from 100,000 to 200,000 rows .
increased cross - namespace limits good news !
we ’ve increased the number of unique , certified namespaces that can be invoked during a single apex transaction .
previously , the limit during a single transaction was 10 .
we 've removed this limit and added a cumulative cross - namespace limit .
there ’s now no limit on the number of certified namespaces that can be invoked in a single transaction .
however , the number of operations that can be performed in each namespace must not exceed the per - transaction limits .
in place of the former limit , there ’s a new limit on the cumulative number of operations that can be made across namespaces in a transaction .
this cumulative limit is 11 times the per - namespace limit .
for example , if the per - namespace limit for soql queries is 100 , a single transaction can perform up to 1,100 soql queries .
in this case , the cumulative limit is 11 times the per - namespace limit of 100 .
these queries can be performed across an unlimited number of namespaces , as long as any one namespace does n't have more than 100 queries .
note :  limits that are shared across all namespaces , such as the limit on maximum cpu time , remain the same .
the new cumulative limit does n’t affect these limits .
the new cross - namespace limit applies to the per - namespace limits listed in execution governors and limits .
note :  these increased cross - namespace limits apply only to namespaces in certified managed packages .
namespaces in packages that are n’t certified do n’t have their own separate governor limits .
the resources they use continue to count against the same governor limits used by your org 's custom code .
take more control over your connected apps with the enhanced connected app plug - in we ’ve extended the apex connectedappplugin  class to give you more control over how your salesforce connected app is invoked .
with the apex invocationcontext enum , you can tell which authentication protocol is invoking the connected app .
you can use the modifysamlresponse  method to modify the saml xml request before the salesforce idp verifies and passes the certificate to the target service provider .
provision your connected apps with confidence provisioning users for your connected app is key to its adoption .
until now , it ’s been a challenge to test and manage the user provisioning process .
but that ’s changed with the new test utility class for writing automated tests .
use the testconnectorutil  class to write automated tests that simulate user provisioning .
invoke the createconnectedapp  method within an apex test to create an instance of your connected app .
for managing the provisioning process , we ’ve extended the userprovisioningrequest  object to better handle provisioning failures .
the extended userprovisioningrequest  object improves support for identifying , resolving , and tracking user provisioning errors .
failures can occur during the provisioning process for several reasons , including network outages , session timeouts , permissions issues , and record locks .
troubleshooting failed uprs is an iterative process : repeat the actions that caused the userprovisioningrequest  ( upr ) to fail , make a change , and then request the salesforce provisioning engine to retry the upr .
each upr is an independent transaction , and it ’s possible for the retry to cause a failure with a different root cause .
so it ’s hard to distinguish failed events that you addressed from the ones that require more action .
369 salesforce summer ’16 release notes apex code to make troubleshooting easier , you can use the state field of the upr object to mark failed events and exclude from future failure reports .
for instance , if you tried to correct the cause of the failure and requested the provisioning engine to retry the upr , mark the failed upr retried .
if the action against the target was completed manually , mark it manually completed .
two new fields were added to the upr object to support this feature .
when a retry event is created , the failed upr is cloned and resubmitted .
the parentid  field contains a lookup to the failed upr to use to clone the new upr .
the retry count  field contains the number of retry attempts that were performed .
you can add custom business logic to the field , like “ retry 5 times then stop and notify your admin . ” view apex test results
more easily the new apex test history page shows all the test results associated with a test run .
the page shows results only for tests that have been run asynchronously .
this feature is available in lightning experience only .
from setup , enter apex  in the quick find  box , and select apex test history to view all test run results for your org .
test results are retained for 30 days after they finish running , unless cleared .
the apex test history page lists the test runs by id .
click a test run id to display all the test methods for that test run .
you can filter the test methods to show passed , failed , or all test methods for a particular test run .
click the test class name to view more details about a specific test run .
configure your apex test runs
more easily in the tooling api
the tooling api ’s runtestsasynchronous ( )  soap call and /runtestsasynchronous/  rest resource now take a testlevel  parameter .
providing a testlevel  enum value of runspecifiedtests , runlocaltests , or runalltestsinorg lets you quickly and easily set up test runs .
this parameter is required in the soap call , although its value can be null .
for the rest resource , the new parameter is optional .
see also : tooling api calls and methods force.com tooling api : rest resources force.com tooling api : soap calls 370 salesforce summer ’16 release notes apex code run soql queries on platformaction with a limit clause when you run a soql query in apex without a limit clause , a limit is added to the query .
however , queries on the platformaction object that contained a limit clause were being rejected , so we removed the limit clause restriction on platformaction queries .
you can now successfully run a soql query containing a limit clause on the platformaction object in apex .
simplify development of asynchronous callouts by using named credentials you can now use named credentials in long - running asynchronous callouts from a visualforce page ’s controller .
a named credential specifies the url of a callout endpoint and its required authentication parameters in one definition .
salesforce manages all authentication for callouts that specify a named credential as the callout endpoint so that your apex code does n’t have to .
you can also skip remote site settings , which are otherwise required for callouts to external sites , for the site defined in the named credential .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
named credentials are now supported in asynchronous web service callouts that use the continuation  class .
previously , named credentials were supported in web service callouts that ran asynchronously only via queueable apex , that is , by implementing the queueable  interface .
in your code , specify the named credential url instead of the long - running service url as the callout endpoint .
a named credential url contains the scheme callout : , the name of the named credential , and an optional path .
for example : callout : my_named_credential / some_path .
example :  the following apex controller , which is associated with a visualforce page , specifies a named credential as the callout endpoint .
public with sharing class continuationcontroller { //
unique label corresponding to the continuation public string requestlabel ; // result of callout public string result { get;set ; } // callout endpoint as a named credential url private static final string named_credential_url = ' callout : my_named_credential / some_path ' ; // action method public object startrequest ( ) { //
create continuation with a timeout continuation con = new continuation(40 ) ; //
set callback method con.continuationmethod='processresponse ' ; //
create callout request httprequest req = new httprequest ( ) ; req.setmethod('get ' ) ; req.setendpoint(named_credential_url ) ; //
add callout request to continuation this.requestlabel = con.addhttprequest(req ) ; //
return the continuation return con ; } //
callback method 371 salesforce summer ’16 release notes apex code public object processresponse ( ) { //
get the response by using the unique label httpresponse response = continuation.getresponse(this.requestlabel ) ; //
set the result variable that is displayed on the visualforce page this.result = response.getbody ( ) ; //
return null to re - render the original visualforce page return null ; } } see also : apex developer guide : named credentials as callout endpoints apex developer guide : make long - running callouts from a visualforce page salesforce help : define a named credential lightning experience : a modern and intelligent user experience suppress null values when serializing apex objects the current implementation of the apex serialize  method returns null  values when serializing apex objects into json .
now we ’ve added a serialize  method with a flag to suppress null  values .
set suppressapexobjectnulls  to true  to suppress them when serializing apex objects into json .
use cors to access apex rest classes cors ( cross - origin resource sharing ) is a w3c recommendation that enables web browsers to request resources from origins other than their own ( cross - origin requests ) .
for example , using cors , a javascript script at https://www.example.com  can request a resource from https://www.salesforce.com .
apex rest now supports cors .
to access apex rest classes from javascript in a web browser , add the origin that ’s serving the script to the cors whitelist .
to add an origin to the cors whitelist , from setup , enter cors in the quick find  box , then select cors .
click new , and then enter an origin url pattern .
the origin url pattern must include https ( unless you ’re using your localhost ) and a domain name and can optionally include a port .
the wildcard character ( * ) is supported and must precede a second - level domain name .
for example , https://*.example.com adds all subdomains of example.com  to the whitelist .
if a browser that supports cors makes a request from an origin in the salesforce cors whitelist , salesforce returns the origin in the access - control - allow - origin  http header .
salesforce also returns any additional cors http headers .
if the origin is n’t in the whitelist , salesforce returns http status code 403 .
you must still pass an oauth token with requests that require it .
see also : ideaexchange : support of cors ( cross - origin resource sharing ) in salesforce rest 372 salesforce summer ’16 release notes apex code view skeleton code for global apex classes in installed managed packages you can now view skeleton code that includes the global constructors , methods , variables , and properties for global apex classes in the managed packages you ’ve installed in your org .
formerly , when you viewed these classes in setup you saw their constructor and method signatures , but in other development environments you saw only ( hidden ) .
you can still see the constructor and method signatures in setup .
now you can also view a skeleton of the code for global classes in the developer console or your favorite ide .
you can also see the skeleton code when retrieving the body of a global managed class using the metadata , soap , or tooling api .
here ’s a sample of what you see now when you open a global apex class from an installed managed package .
non - global constructors , methods , properties , and fields still are n’t shown .
example : / * this file is generated and is n't the actual source code for this managed global class .
this read - only file shows the class 's global constructors , methods , variables , and properties .
to enable code to compile , all methods return null . * / global class myclass { global decimal mydec ; global string mystring { get ; set ; } global myclass ( ) { } global integer mymethod(integer arg1 ) { return null ; } } get a map of populated sobject fields we ’ve added a method on the apex sobject class that makes it more efficient to iterate over fields that have been populated in memory .
previously , iterating over just the populated the fields of an sobject involved some complicated programming .
for example , if you queried an sobject using soql , it was n’t easy to tell which fields were returned .
in summer ’16 , we ’ve introduced a new method on the sobject class that returns a map of populated field names and their corresponding values : map <
string , object > getpopulatedfieldsasmap ( ) the returned map contains only the fields that have been populated in memory for the sobject instance , which makes it easy to iterate over those fields .
a field is populated in memory in the following cases . •
the field has been queried by a soql statement . •
the field has been explicitly set before the call to the getpopulatedfieldsasmap ( )  method .
fields on related objects that are queried or set are also returned in the map .
the following example iterates over the map returned by the getpopulatedfieldsasmap ( )  method after a soql query .
account a = new account ( ) ; a.name = ' testmapaccount1 ' ; insert a ; 373 salesforce summer ’16 release notes apex code a = [ select id , name from account where id=:a .
id ] ; map < string , object > fieldstovalue = a.getpopulatedfieldsasmap ( ) ; for ( string fieldname : fieldstovalue.keyset ( ) ) { system.debug('field name is ' + fieldname + ' , value is ' + fieldstovalue.get(fieldname ) ) ; } } //
example debug statement output : //
debug|field name is i d , value is 001r0000003eppkiao //
debug|field name is name , value is testmapaccount1 this example iterates over the map returned by the getpopulatedfieldsasmap ( )  method after fields on the sobject are explicitly set .
account a = new account ( ) ; a.name = ' testmapaccount2 ' ; a.phone = ' 123 - 4567 ' ; insert a ; map < string , object > fieldstovalue = a.getpopulatedfieldsasmap ( ) ; for ( string fieldname : fieldstovalue.keyset ( ) ) { system.debug('field name is ' + fieldname + ' , value is ' + fieldstovalue.get(fieldname ) ) ; //
example debug statement output : //
debug|field name is name , value is testmapaccount2 //
debug|field name is phone , value is 123 - 4567 //
debug|field name is i d , value is 001r0000003epppiao the following example shows how to use the getpopulatedfieldsasmap ( )  method with related objects .
account a = new account ( ) ; a.name='testmapaccount3 ' ; insert a ; contact c = new contact ( ) ; c.firstname='testcontactfirstname ' ; c.lastname = ' testcontactlastname ' ; c.accountid = a.id ; insert c ; c = [ select i d , contact .
firstname , contact .
account .
name from contact where id=:c.id limit 1 ] ; map < string , object > fieldstovalue = c.getpopulatedfieldsasmap ( ) ; //
to get the fields on account , get the account object // and call getmappopulatedfieldsasmap ( ) on that object .
a = ( account)fieldstovalue.get('account ' ) ; fieldstovalue = a.getpopulatedfieldsasmap ( ) ; for ( string fieldname : fieldstovalue.keyset ( ) ) { system.debug('field name is ' + fieldname + ' , value is ' + fieldstovalue.get(fieldname ) ) ; 374 salesforce summer ’16 release notes apex code } //
example debug statement output : //
debug|field name is i d , value is 001r0000003eppuiao //

connectapi ( chatter in apex ) create custom experiences in salesforce using chatter in apex .
in this release , you can include a code block in your feed posts , get article recommendations , and more .
many chatter rest api resource actions are exposed as static methods on apex classes in the connectapi  namespace .
these methods use other connectapi  classes to input and return information .
the connectapi  namespace is referred to as chatter in apex .
in apex , it ’s possible to access some chatter data using soql queries and objects .
however , connectapi  classes expose chatter data in a much simpler way .
data is localized and structured for display .
for example , instead of making many calls to access and assemble a feed , you can do it with a single call .
note :  to integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third - party web applications with chatter and communities , use chatter rest api .

rypple increased non - selective query limits we ’ve increased the apex non - selective query limit from 100,000 to 200,000 rows .
to avoid long execution times , there is a limit to the number of rows you can query with nonselective soql queries .
previously , an error occurred when a non - selective query in a trigger executes against an object that contains more than 100,00 records .
that limit has been raised to 200,000 records .
a query is selective when one of the query filters is on an indexed field and the query filter reduces the resulting number of rows below a system - defined threshold .
383 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning components lightning components the lightning component framework powers lightning experience and salesforce1 .
use the framework to build mobile apps and pages in lightning experience , salesforce1 , salesforce classic , and communities .
enhancements in this release are focused on security and supportability with critical releases for lockerservice and access - check error enforcement .
this release also includes support for the $ resource  global value provider and enhancements to the developer console to make it easier to create components and applications for use in different contexts .
use out - of - the - box components or build your own components with javascript , html , css , apex , or any web - enabled code .
the appexchange for components provides components created by salesforce partners , or you can publish your own components .
for more information , refer to the lightning components developer ’s guide .
editions available for use in : contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions create lightning components using the ui in enterprise , performance , unlimited , developer editions or a sandbox .

this section : enforce access check errors ( critical update ) this critical update enforces access check violations for lightning resources .
previously , the access violations only generated warnings .
improved access check enforcement enables component authors to have greater control over how their components are used .
enhance security with lockerservice ( critical update ) lockerservice is a powerful new security architecture for lightning components that is a critical update for this release .
lockerservice enhances security by isolating individual lightning components in their own containers .
lockerservice also promotes best practices that improve the supportability of your code by only allowing access to supported apis and eliminating access to non - published framework internals .
prepare your lightning components for lockerservice with the salesforce lightning cli use lightning cli , a code linting tool , to validate your code for use within the lockerservice security architecture .
lightning cli is a heroku toolbelt plugin that lets you scan your code for lightning - specific issues .
this tool is useful for preparing your lightning code for lockerservice enablement .
debug lightning components with the salesforce lightning inspector debugging can be difficult !
the salesforce lightning inspector gives you more insight into what ’s happening under the covers when you ’re developing lightning components .
create lightning components with configurations in the developer console configurations make it easier to create a component or application for a specific purpose , like a lightning page or lightning communities page , or a navigation item in lightning experience or salesforce1 .
the new lightning bundle panel in the developer console offers a choice of component configurations when you create a lightning component or application bundle .
reference static resources with the $ resource global value provider the $ resource  global value provider lets you reference images , style sheets , and javascript code you ’ve uploaded in static resources .
using $ resource lets you reference assets by name , without worrying about the gory details of urls or file paths .
you can use $ resource  in lightning components markup and within javascript controller and helper code .
lightning design tokens ( generally available ) capture the essential values of your visual design into named tokens .
define the token values once and reuse them throughout your lightning components css resources .
tokens make it easy to ensure that your design is consistent , and even easier to update it as your design evolves .
384 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning components more intuitive behavior for abortable actions an abortable action queued to be sent to the server is now aborted if the component that created the action is no longer valid , that is cmp.isvalid ( ) = = false .
previously , an abortable action in the queue was aborted if a subsequent abortable action was added to the queue .
the new behavior for aborting actions is more intuitive and predictable because the only factor for aborting actions is the component that creates the action .
improve app - level messaging with powerful , accessible toasts jazz up your app ’s popup messaging with new attributes on the force : showtoast  api event .
the new toasts entity is designed for mobile and desktop apps , and includes support for new features and enhanced user interface design .
salesforce provides this attribute to surface enhanced toasts in lightning experience and the salesforce1 mobile browser app .

enforce access check errors ( critical update )
this critical update enforces access check violations for lightning resources .
previously , the access violations only generated warnings .
improved access check enforcement enables component authors to have greater control over how their components are used .
in spring ’16 , we warned you that stricter enforcement was coming in summer ’16 .
that day has now arrived with this critical update , which lets you test the new behavior , but also gives you time to fix any access check errors .
you can control access to lightning resources via the access  system attribute .
this critical update enforces access check violations for access  on these tags : • < aura : application > •
< aura : attribute > •
< aura : component > •
< aura : interface > note :  access check failures for < aura : event >  and < aura : method >  tags are n't enforced yet and are n’t covered by this critical release .
they show up as warnings in your browser console if you 've enabled debug mode .
the framework will enforce the < aura : event >  and < aura : method >  access checks more strictly in a later release so you should n’t ignore them .
the default value for lightning resources is access="public " , which means the resources are available only within the same namespace .
this sample component has global access .
< aura : component access="global " > ...
< /aura : component > access violations if your code accesses a resource , such as a component or attribute , that does n’t have an access  system attribute allowing you to access it , the code does n’t execute or returns undefined .
you also see an error message in your browser console if you enabled 385 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning components debug mode .
access check enforcement is a critical update in this release .
if you do n’t update it , you continue to see warning messages in the browser console instead of errors .
fixing access check errors you can fix access check errors using one or more of these techniques . •
add appropriate access  system attributes to the resources that you own .
• remove references in your code to resources that are n’t available .
in the earlier example , markup://c : targetcomponent does n't have an access value allowing markup://c : sourcecomponent  to access it .
• ensure that any attribute that you ’re accessing exists by looking at its < aura : attribute >  definition .
confirm that you ’re using the correct case - sensitive spelling for the name . accessing an undefined attribute or an attribute that is out of scope , for example a private attribute ,
triggers the same access violation message .
the access context does n’t know whether the attribute is undefined or inaccessible .
activate the critical update we recommend that you test this update in a sandbox or developer edition org to verify correct behavior before enabling it in your production org .
to activate this critical update : 1 .
from setup , enter critical updates  in the quick find  box , and then select critical updates . 2 .
for “ enforce lightning components access checks ” , click activate .
for more information about the access  system attribute , see the lightning components developer guide .
enhance security with lockerservice ( critical update ) lockerservice is a powerful new security architecture for lightning components that is a critical update for this release .
lockerservice enhances security by isolating individual lightning components in their own containers .
lockerservice also promotes best practices that improve the supportability of your code by only allowing access to supported apis and eliminating access to non - published framework internals .
lockerservice requirements lockerservice enforces several security features in your code .
javascript es5 strict mode enforcement javascript es5 strict mode is implicitly enabled .
you do n't need to specify " use strict "  in your code .
enforcement includes declaration of variables with the var  keyword and other javascript coding best practices .
the libraries that your components use must also work in strict mode .
dom access containment a component can only traverse the dom and access elements created by that component .
this behavior prevents the anti - pattern of reaching into dom elements owned by other components .
restrictions to global references lockerservice applies restrictions to global references .
you can access intrinsic objects , such as array .
lockerservice provides secure versions of non - intrinsic objects , such as window .
the secure object versions automatically and seamlessly control access to the object and its properties .
use the salesforce lightning cli tool to scan your code for lightning - specific issues .
386 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning components access to supported javascript api framework methods only you can access published , supported javascript api framework methods only .
these methods are published in the reference doc app at https://yourdomain.lightning.force.com / auradocs / reference.app .
previously , unsupported methods were accessible , which exposed your code to the risk of breaking when unsupported methods were changed or removed .
the preceding security features are enforced when lockerservice is active in your org .
lockerservice is a critical update for this release .
lockerservice will be automatically activated for all orgs in the spring release .
before the spring release , you can manually activate and deactivate the update as often as you need to evaluate the impact on your org .
in a future release , lockerservice will be extended to cover additional security features .
stricter content security policy ( csp ) lockerservice will tighten csp to eliminate the possibility of cross - site scripting attacks by disallowing the unsafe - inline  and unsafe - eval  keywords for inline scripts ( script - src ) .
as a best practice , eliminate use of these keywords in your code , and update third - party libraries to modern versions that do n’t depend on unsafe - inline  or unsafe - eval .
note :  ie11 does n’t support csp , so we recommend using other supported browsers for enhanced security .
these csp changes are n’t enforced by lockerservice currently , but it ’s worth planning ahead .
the salesforce lightning cli tool reports issues that are enforced by lockerservice today , as well as issues that are n’t enforced today , but which are planned to be enforced in the future .
do n’t use instanceof when lockerservice is enabled , the instanceof operator is unreliable due to the potential presence of multiple windows or frames .
to determine a variable type , use typeof  or a standard javascript method , such as array.isarray ( ) , instead .
activate the critical update lockerservice is a critical update for this release .
lockerservice will be automatically activated for all orgs in the spring release .
before the spring release , you can manually activate and deactivate the update as often as you need to evaluate the impact on your org .
to activate this critical update : 1 .
from setup , enter critical updates  in the quick find  box , and then select critical updates . 2 .
for “
enable lightning lockerservice security ” , click activate . 3 .
refresh your browser page to proceed with lockerservice enabled .
note :  lockerservice is automatically enabled for : • new orgs created after the summer ’16 release • all existing orgs with no custom lightning components if you do n’t see this critical update in your org , lockerservice has been automatically enabled and ca n’t be disabled .
automatic enablement occurs within 24 hours after the release .
you can disable lockerservice in a developer edition org created after the summer ’16 release .
we recommend that you test lockerservice in a developer edition org to verify correct behavior of your components before enabling it in your production org .

installed from managed packages if the critical update is not visible , there is an exception for this release for components installed from a managed package .
these components continue to run without enforcement of lockerservice restrictions
. 387 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning components if the critical update is n’t visible , components that you create in your org run with enforcement of lockerservice restrictions .
components created in your org are in the default namespace , c , or in your org ’s namespace , if you created a namespace .
this exception is just for this release .

the salesforce lightning inspector gives you more insight into what ’s happening under the covers when you ’re developing lightning components .
the salesforce lightning inspector is a google chrome devtools extension that helps you debug lightning components and profile component performance .
we released this extension in february 2016 .
check it out if you haven’t seen it already !
the extension helps you to : • navigate the component tree in your app , inspect components and their associated dom elements . •
identify performance bottlenecks by looking at a graph of component creation time .
• debug server interactions faster by monitoring and modifying responses .
• test the fault tolerance of your app by simulating error conditions or dropped action responses .
388 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning components • track the sequence of event firing and handling for one or more actions .
the chrome extension adds a lightning tab to the devtools menu .
use the sub tabs to inspect different aspects of your app .
for details on use and installation , see the lightning components developer guide . create lightning components with configurations in the developer console configurations make it easier to create a component or application for a specific purpose , like a lightning page or lightning communities page , or a navigation item in lightning experience or salesforce1 .
the new lightning bundle panel in the developer console offers a choice of component configurations when you create a lightning component or application bundle .
using configurations is optional .
you can use them in any combination , including all or none .
configurations add the interfaces required to support using the component in the desired context .
for example , when you choose the lightning tab configuration , your new component includes implements="force : apphostable "  in the component stub .
389 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning components one configuration is available for lightning application bundles .
the lightning out dependency app configuration creates an empty lightning out dependency app .
it adds extends="ltng : outapp "  to the generated app stub .
the following configurations are available for creating a component . •
lightning tab — creates a component for use as a navigation element in lightning experience or salesforce1 .
adds implements="force : apphostable "  to the generated component stub .
• lightning page — creates a component for use in lightning pages or the lightning app builder .
adds implements="flexipage : availableforallpagetypes " and access="global " to the generated component stub . •
lightning record page — creates a component for use on a record home page in lightning experience .
adds implements="flexipage : availableforrecordhome , force : hasrecordid "  and access="global " to the generated component stub . •
lightning communities page — creates a component that ’s available for drag and drop in the community builder .
adds implements="forcecommunity : availableforallpagetypes "  and access="global "  to the generated component stub .

using $ resource lets you reference assets by name , without worrying about the gory details of urls or file paths .
you can use $ resource  in lightning components markup and within javascript controller and helper code .
to reference a specific resource in component markup , use $ resource.resourcename within an expression .
include css style sheets or javascript libraries into a component using the < ltng : require >  tag .
to obtain a reference to a static resource in javascript code , use $ a.get('$resource.resourcename ' ) .

help : static resources lightning design tokens ( generally available ) capture the essential values of your visual design into named tokens . define the token values once and reuse them throughout your lightning components css resources .
tokens make it easy to ensure that your design is consistent , and even easier to update it as your design evolves .
in the previous release , design tokens were available as a developer preview .
we ’re excited to let you know they ’re now generally available , and enabled for all orgs .
in addition , you can create more than one tokens file in an org .
we ’re even letting you name them something besides
“ defaulttokens” ... but only tokens defined in defaulttokens  are available to your lightning components .
go wild ... within the naming constraints of all lightning bundles .
ok , so it ’s not an open bar and jell - o shots .
it ’s still a party .
create additional tokens bundles to contain logical groups of tokens .
then pull them into defaulttokens  using the extends attribute .
this lets you treat your additional tokens bundles just like standard tokens .
see also : lightning components developer guide : styling with design tokens more intuitive behavior for abortable actions an abortable action queued to be sent to the server is now aborted if the component that created the action is no longer valid , that is cmp.isvalid ( ) = = false .
previously , an abortable action in the queue was aborted if a subsequent abortable action was added to the queue .
the new behavior for aborting actions is more intuitive and predictable because the only factor for aborting actions is the component that creates the action .
an abortable action is sent to the server and executed normally unless the component that created the action is invalid before the action is sent to the server .
if the component that created the action is invalid , the action state is set to aborted .
a non - abortable action is always sent to the server and ca n't be aborted in the queue .
if an action response returns from the server and the associated component is now invalid , the logic has been executed on the server but the action state is set to aborted .
this is true whether or not the action is marked as abortable .
if the action state is set to aborted , only the callback logic associated with the aborted  state ( action.getstate ( ) = = = " aborted " ) will be executed .
this enables components to optionally log a message or clean up if they had an aborted action .
391 salesforce summer ’16 release notes lightning components improve app - level messaging with powerful , accessible toasts jazz up your app ’s popup messaging with new attributes on the force : showtoast  api event .
the new toasts entity is designed for mobile and desktop apps , and includes support for new features and enhanced user interface design .
salesforce provides this attribute to surface enhanced toasts in lightning experience and the salesforce1 mobile browser app .
editions available in all editions enhanced toast development means friendlier , more flexible messaging . •
one toast can now provide multiple actions for the user .
previously , there was only one action per toast . •
you can use pre - configured toasts or customize the styling of your toast messages . •
when multiple toasts are generated , they stack so that the user can address them consecutively .
note :  toasts currently stack only in lightning experience . •
messages are fully accessible .
there are no changes to component - level toasts .
note :  the force : hidetoast  event does n’t work with the new toasts .

more readable styling markup with the join expression markup can get messy when you specify the class names to apply based on the component attribute values .
try using a join expression for easier - to - read markup .
this example sets the class names based on the component attribute values .
it ’s readable , but the spaces between class names are easy to forget .
< li class= " { ! ' calendarevent ' + v.zoomdirection + ' ' + ( v.past ? ' pastevent ' : '' ) + ( v.zoomed ? ' zoom ' : '' ) + ( v.multidayfragment ? ' multidayfragment ' : ' ' ) } " > < ! -- content here -- > < /li

sometimes , if the markup is not broken into multiple lines , it can hurt your eyes or make you mutter profanities under your breath .
< li class= " { ! ' calendarevent ' + v.zoomdirection + ' ' + ( v.past ? ' pastevent ' : '' ) + ( v.zoomed ? ' zoom ' : '' ) + ( v.multidayfragment ? ' multidayfragment ' : ' ' ) } " > < ! -- content here -- > < /li >

403 salesforce summer ’16 release notes api sosl salesforce object search language ( sosl ) includes two new statements , localized formatting for numerical fields , and expanded support for aliasing .
in
this section : use aliasing in more statements format ( ) , tolabel ( ) , and convertcurrency ( )  now support aliases .
aliasing provides a way to identify the field when you ’re processing the query results in your code .
apply localized formatting to numerical fields use format ( )  with find  to apply localized formatting to standard and custom number , date , time , and currency fields .
return metadata in responses use with metadata  to return metadata , such as entity name and label , in the response .
filter product searches by price book id use with pricebookid  to narrow your product search results by a single price book id .
use aliasing in more statements format ( ) , tolabel ( ) , and convertcurrency ( )  now support aliases .
aliasing provides a way to identify the field when you ’re processing the query results in your code .
for example : find { acme } returning account(annualrevenue , convertcurrency(annualrevenue ) aliascurrency ) apply localized formatting to numerical fields use format ( )  with find  to apply localized formatting to standard and custom number , date , time , and currency fields .
for example : find { acme } returning account(id , lastmodifieddate , format(lastmodifieddate ) formatteddate ) return metadata in responses use with metadata  to return metadata , such as entity name and label , in the response .
to include metadata in the response , use the labels  value , which returns the display label for the fields returned in search results .
for example : find { acme } returning account(id , name ) with metadata='labels ' an example of the metadata portion of the response : " metadata " : { } , { " entitylabelmetadata " : [ { " entityname " : " account " , " entityfieldlabels " : [ { " name " : " i d " , " value " : " account id " 404 salesforce summer ’16 release notes api " name " : " name " , " value " : " account name " filter product searches by price book id use with pricebookid  to narrow your product search results by a single price book id .
for example : find { laptop } returning product2 with pricebookid = ' 01sxx0000002mffaae ' rest api rest api includes several new and changed resources .
new resources : flows and flow interviews ( pilot ) have you ever wanted to build your own runtime experience for visual workflow ?
here ’s your chance .
we ’re providing two resources to describe flows and three resources to describe and manipulate interviews .
note :  the flow runtime rest api is currently available to select customers through a pilot program .
to be nominated to join this pilot program , contact salesforce .
additional terms and conditions may apply to participate in the pilot program .
please note that pilot programs are subject to change , and as such , we can not guarantee acceptance into this pilot program or a particular time frame in which this feature can be enabled .
any unreleased services or features referenced in this document , press releases , or public statements are not currently available and may not be delivered on time or at all .
customers who purchase our services should make their purchase decisions based upon features that are currently available .
flows /vxx.x / process / flows lists active flow definitions in your organization .
specific flow /vxx.x / process / flows / flowname lists summary information about a specific flow paused interviews /vxx.x / process / interviews lists paused interviews that the running user can resume .
new interview /vxx.x / process / interviews / flowname starts a flow interview .
specific interview /vxx.x / process / interviews / flowname / guid 405 salesforce summer ’16 release notes api continues , pauses , or finishes an in - progress interview , or resumes a paused interview .
see also : customize the look and feel of flow interviews ( pilot ) changed resources : sobject basic information , sobject describe , and describe global we added the mruenabled  field to the responses of these resources .
this field indicates whether most
recently used ( mru ) list functionality is enabled for the object ( true ) or not ( false ) .
changed resource : sobject rows by external id as a special case , you can now use this resource to create a record by posting to /vxx.x / sobjects / sobjectname / id  in api version 37.0 and later .
this pattern represents the use of i d  as the specified external id field and null  as the value .
it ’s useful when you ’re writing code to upsert multiple records by different external ids and you do n’t want to request a separate resource .
changed resource : parameterized search
the resource includes a new wrapper in the response body , support for aliasing and formatting in the fields  parameter , and two new parameters .
new searchrecords  wrapper in response body a new searchrecords  tag surrounds the content in responses .
for example : { " searchrecords " : [ { " attributes " : { " type " : " contact " , " url " : " /services / data / v36.0/sobjects / contact/003xx000004traiaac " } , " i d " : " 003xx000004traiaac " , " firstname " : " smith " , " lastname " : " johnson " } , { " attributes " : { } , " i d " : " 001xx000003dhxnaao " , " numberofemployees " : 100 } ] } " type " : " account " , " url " : " /services / data / v36.0/sobjects / account/001xx000003dhxnaao " note :  due to this change , make sure that you can parse the new response syntax before upgrading to api version 37.0 . aliasing and new format  function available in fields  for get and post the format  function applies localized formatting to standard and custom number , date , time , and currency fields .
aliasing is supported within fields  for tolabel , convertcurrency , and format .
for example : { ... " sobjects " : [ { " name " : " opportunity " , " fields":["id " , " format(amount ) aliasamount " ] } ] 406 salesforce summer ’16 release notes api ... } new metadata  parameter specifies if metadata is returned in the response .
no metadata is returned by default .
an example of a response with metadata : { " type " : " account " , " url " : " /services / data / v35.0/sobjects / account/001d000000iqhsliaz " " searchrecords " : [ { " attributes " : { } , " i d " : " 001d000000iqhsliaz " , } , { " attributes " : { " type " : " account " , " url " : " /services / data / v35.0/sobjects / account/001d000000iomaziab " } , " i d " : " 001d000000iomaziab " , } ] , " metadata " : { " entitylabelmetadata " : [ { " entityname " : " account " , " entityfieldlabels " : [ { " name " : " i d " , " value " : " account id " } , { " name " : " name " , " value " : " account name " } ] } ] } } new pricebookid  parameter filters product search results by a price book id for only the product2 object .
the price book id must be associated with the product that you ’re searching for .
for example : ?
q = laptop&sobject = product2&pricebookid=01sxx0000002mffaae changed resource : relevant items we added the lastupdatedid  parameter in the response header .
the parameter provides a unique code that you can use in subsequent calls to compare the results of a complete result set with the results in this response list .
each new results set has separate lastupdatedid  parameters .
for example : lastupdatedid : 102959935 newresultsetsincelastquery : true 407 salesforce summer ’16 release notes api changed resource : sobject suggested articles for case the categories  parameter replaces categoryid .
the categories  parameter is the named pair of a data category group and a data category api name ( not category title ) for desired articles .
use the syntax categories={"group":"category"}. in addition , we added the topics  parameter , which lists the topic for the returned articles .
new categories  parameter replaces categoryid consider encoding characters in the url .
for example : categories=%7b%22regions%22%3a%22asia%22%2c%22 products%22%3a%22laptops%22%7d
for multiple categories , specify multiple pairs of data category groups and data categories .
for example : categories={"regions":"asia","products":"laptops " } new topics  parameter for example , topics = outlook&topics = email
. changed resource : search suggested article title matches we added the topics  parameter , which lists the topic for the returned articles .
for example : topics = outlook&topics
= email access limit information for hourly odata callouts when you query the limits resource , it now returns the maximum and remaining hourly odata callouts for your org .
limits for industries you can retrieve a maximum of 200 records in one request instead of the 2,000 records previously documented .
soap api soap api includes changed calls and changed headers .
changed calls describeglobal ( )  and describeglobalresult we added the mruenabled  field , which indicates whether most
recently used ( mru ) list functionality is enabled for the object ( true ) or not ( false ) .
describeflexipages ( )  and describeflexipageresult the sobjecttype  field is no longer reserved for future use .
to support the general availability of creating and editing record pages in lightning experience , this field represents the object a flexipage is associated with .
the type  field now supports the following values : • homepage — represents a lightning page that is used to override the home page in lightning experience .
• recordpage — represents a lightning page used to override an object record page in lightning experience . 408 salesforce summer ’16 release notes api search ( )  and searchresult we added the searchresultsmetadata  property .
the property includes metadata , such as object name and field labels , for the records returned .
metadata is returned only if specified in the request using with metadata  and the value labels in the sosl search string .
for example : find { acme } returning account with metadata='labels ' changed headers debuggingheader we ’ve standardized debuggingheader across the apis .
you can now provide a categories  parameter in the soap , metadata , and tooling apis .
the categories  parameter is of type loginfo .
loginfo is a mapping of category  to level .
previously , both categories and the debuglevel enumeration were available in the tooling and metadata apis , but only debuglevel was available in the soap api .
if you ’d prefer not to switch , you can continue to use the debuglevel  enum .
but we recommend taking advantage of the increased granularity offered by categories .
in case you decide to continue using debuglevel , we ’ve added the profiling , callout , and detail  logging levels to this enum .
previously , these values were available in the tooling and metadata apis but not in the soap api .
we ’ve also updated all our debuggingheader documentation .
between you and me : the docs did n’t reflect the old structure or the new structure of this header .
( cue sad trombone sound . )
ownerchangeoptions the enforcenewownerhasreadaccess  type has been added to the changeowneroption  field .
if true , this type requires the new record owner to have at least read access to the record .

bulk api bulk api includes support for cross - origin resource sharing ( cors ) and enhancements for bigobjects .
in
this section : use cors to access bulk api cors ( cross - origin resource sharing ) is a w3c recommendation that enables web browsers to request resources from origins other than their own ( cross - origin requests ) .
for example , using cors , a javascript script at https://www.example.com  can request a resource from https://www.salesforce.com .
bulk api now supports cors .
bulk api for bigobjects validates data at import the bulk api for bigobjects has been enhanced to perform data validation and provide meaningful error messages .
use cors to access bulk api cors ( cross - origin resource sharing ) is a w3c recommendation that enables web browsers to request resources from origins other than their own ( cross - origin requests ) .
for example , using cors , a javascript script at https://www.example.com  can request a resource from https://www.salesforce.com .
bulk api now supports cors .
to access this api from javascript in a web browser , add the origin that ’s serving the script to the cors whitelist .
to add an origin to the cors whitelist , from setup , enter cors  in the quick find  box , then select cors .
click new , and then enter an origin url pattern .
the origin url pattern must include https ( unless you ’re using your localhost ) and a domain name and can optionally include a port .
the wildcard character ( * ) is supported and must precede a second - level domain name .
for example , https://*.example.com adds all subdomains of example.com  to the whitelist .
if a browser that supports cors makes a request from an origin in the salesforce cors whitelist , salesforce returns the origin in the access - control - allow - origin  http header .
salesforce also returns any additional cors http headers .
if the origin is n’t in the whitelist , salesforce returns http status code 403 .
418 salesforce summer ’16 release notes api you must still pass an oauth token with requests that require it . see also : ideaexchange : support of cors ( cross - origin resource sharing ) in salesforce rest bulk api for bigobjects validates data at import the bulk api for bigobjects has been enhanced to perform data validation and provide meaningful error messages .
note :  this feature is available to select customers through a pilot program .
to be nominated to join this pilot program , contact salesforce.com .
additional terms and conditions may apply to participate in the pilot program .
bulk api now validates data at the time of import , and generates an error message for the first occurrence of invalid data in any row of the data file .
this makes it easy to identify any data that was not imported , and the specific reason why the import failed .
the error messages are written to a new bigobject called backgroundoperationresult .
the message  field stores the text of the error message .
the parentid  field stores the id of the batch used for importing the data .
the validation performed depends on the type of data being imported .
• text — the length of the input string must be less than or equal to the length of the corresponding text field in the target object .
• number —
the input data must be a number , whose scale and precision are compatible with the corresponding number field in the target object .
• id — the input data must be a valid 15- or 18-character id .
• datetime —
the input data must be a valid datetime value , in the approved format .
• lookup —
the lookup value must be a valid 15- or 18-character id .
after importing any data , you can check for errors by querying the backgroundoperationresult  object .
for example , this query returns details of all errors from the data whose batch id is 751xx000000006oaaq .
select createdbyid , createddate , i d , message , messagetype , parentid from backgroundoperationresult where parentid = “ 751xx000000006oaaq ”
streaming api streaming api includes durable pushtopic streaming and filters for pushtopic subscriptions .
in
this section : replay events with durable pushtopic streaming ( generally available ) you can now replay pushtopic - based streaming events ! salesforce stores events for 24 hours , so you can retrieve stored events during that window .
this release , we expanded support of durable streaming to include pushtopic events , in addition to generic events .
apply filters to your pushtopic subscriptions narrow down your pushtopic event notifications to a meaningful set by adding filter criteria to your subscription uri .
replay events with durable pushtopic streaming ( generally available ) you can now replay pushtopic - based streaming events ! salesforce stores events for 24 hours , so you can retrieve stored events during that window .
this release , we expanded support of durable streaming to include pushtopic events , in addition to generic events .
419 salesforce summer ’16 release notes api the streaming api event framework decouples event producers from event consumers .
as a result , a subscriber can retrieve events at any time and is n’t restricted to listening to events at the time they ’re sent .
single endpoint use the streaming api endpoint to replay event notifications for durable pushtopic events .
this endpoint also applies to durable generic events .
https://salesforce_instance / cometd/37.0/
note :  durable streaming is supported at this endpoint starting with api version 37.0 .
if you ’re using durable generic streaming in version 36.0 , we recommend that you upgrade to version 37.0 and use this endpoint instead of https://salesforce_instance / cometd / replay/36.0/. event numbering each broadcasted event is assigned a numeric id .
ids are incremented and not guaranteed to be contiguous for consecutive events .
each id is guaranteed to be higher than the id of the previous event .
for example , the event following the event with id 999 can have an id of 1,025 .
the id is unique for the org and the channel .
the ids of deleted events are n’t reused .
the id is added in the replayid  field of the notification message .
for example , this json message shows the replayid field in the event object for a pushtopic event .
{ " clientid":"2t80j2hcog29sdh9ihjd9643a " , " data " : { " event " : { " createddate":"2016 - 03 - 29t16:40:08.208z " , " replayid":13 , " type":"created " } , " sobject " : { " website" : null , " id":"001d000000knaxjiaj " , " name":"tictactoe " } } } , " channel":" / topic / testaccountstreaming " note :  the time format of the createddate  field value has changed to make it consistent with the time format used in the salesforce app .
the time portion now ends with a z  suffix instead of + 0000 .
both suffixes denote a utc time zone .
replaying events a subscriber can choose which events to receive , such as all events within the retention window or starting after a particular event .
the default is to receive only the new events sent after subscribing .
events outside the 24-hour retention period are discarded .
this high - level diagram shows how event consumers can read a stream of events by using various replay options . 420 salesforce summer ’16 release notes api replay option replay id -1 -2 table 3 : replay options description subscriber receives all events after the event specified by its replayid  value .
subscriber receives new events that are broadcast after the client subscribes .
subscriber receives all events , including past events that are within the 24-hour retention window and new events sent after subscription .
cometd extension
the replay mechanism is implemented in a salesforce - provided cometd extension .
a sample extension is provided in javascript and another in java .
for example , you can register the extension as follows in javascript . //
register streaming extension var replayextension = new cometdreplayextension ( ) ; replayextension.setchannel(<streaming channel to subscribe to > ) ; replayextension.setreplay(<event replay option > ) ; cometd.registerextension('myreplayextensionname ' , replayextension ) ; for a visualforce sample that uses the cometd extension in javascript , see the salesforce durable streaming demo on github .
a walkthrough of this sample is provided in the summer ’16 version of the streaming api developer guide .
for cometd client extensions to replay events in java and javascript , see https://github.com/developerforce/streamingreplayclientextensions .
apply filters to your pushtopic subscriptions narrow down your pushtopic event notifications to a meaningful set by adding filter criteria to your subscription uri .
specify the filter criteria in an expression you append to the subscription uri , as follows . /topic
/ channelname?<expression > channelname  is the channel , and < expression >  is the expression containing one or more conditions .
join conditions with the &  operator .
only the &  operator is supported .
use this syntax for the < expression>. ?
fielda = valuea&fieldb = valueb & ... 421 salesforce summer ’16 release notes api include each field used in a filter condition in the pushtopic query .
the &  operator acts like the logical or operator , so record events are matched if any condition is true .
note :  if you use an id in filter criteria , use the 18-character id format ; 15-character ids are n’t supported .
example :  this subscription returns event notifications for records whose industry is energy or shipping city is san francisco . /topic
/ mychannel?industry='energy'&shippingcity='san francisco ' the pushtopic query for this subscription includes the industry  and shippingcity  fields .
