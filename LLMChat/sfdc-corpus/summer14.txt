29 general enhancements api access change for connected apps api access change for connected apps beginning with the summer ' 14 release , all users of approved connected apps must have the “
api enabled ” profile permission turned on to allow access to all features .
in winter ‘ 14 we introduced a program that allows specific approved , security - reviewed connected apps from salesforce.com and our partners to integrate with salesforce using a process that lets the connected app establish an api connection regardless of user profile settings .
to ensure your users’ access to data is consistent with the permissions you have enabled , these apps will be required to respect user profile permissions for api access starting in summer ‘ 14 .
with this change , users who do n’t have the “
api enabled ” profile permission turned on will no longer be able to use the affected connected apps .
the list of affected connected apps from salesforce.com includes : salesforce1 downloadable apps for ios and android devices •
salesforce for outlook • • connect for outlook • connect for office this change affects all salesforce , chatter , and communities users .
for the complete list of affected apps and expected changes in app behavior for different types of users , see the api access change for connected apps knowledge article .
if you want your users to continue to have access to the affected connected apps , turn on the “ api enabled ” permission .
you can accomplish this through either a profile update or an appropriate permission set .
keep in mind that this will grant users api access to your organization and its data .
if you decide not to grant access , you should notify end users who do not have the “
api enabled ” profile permission that they will not be able to use the affected connected apps once your organization is upgraded to summer ‘ 14 .
if you are using an affected connected app developed by a salesforce.com partner or isv , you should contact the app provider for details on the potential impact .
a list of affected partner connected apps is available in the api access change for connected apps knowledge article .
your data is protected by security tools in the application , including org - wide sharing settings , object - level security , and field - level security .
this applies regardless of how users are accessing data , whether through the api or an application , to ensure that users do n’t have improper access to data .
for further information on application security settings , see securing data access in the salesforce help .

quickly access salesforce events sales reps and sales managers who use salesforce events to track and log activities can now easily access their events from the salesforce1 navigation menu ( instead of having to tap through to activities related lists on different objects ) .
events are included in the navigation menu by default .
administrators can customize the location where the events item displays in the navigation menu — from setup , click mobile administration > mobile navigation .
selecting events displays the my events list , which shows the user ’s current and future salesforce events .
with the exception of multiday events that haven’t concluded yet , past events are n’t available .
56 mobile salesforce1 enhancements notes about the my events list : • the list displays events that are owned by the user , that the user created for him- or herself , and that the user ( or a user ’s groups ) are invited to .
events that are available to a user through your organization ’s role hierarchy settings are n’t displayed , nor are proposed events .
initially up to 15 events are displayed in the list ; to see more events , pull up at the bottom of the list . •
•
events in the list are sorted by start time .
all - day events are displayed at the top of the list . •
each event in the list shows either the date and time of the event or “
all - day event , ” and up to four information fields .
these fields are determined by the event compact layout that ’s in effect for the specific event .
see the salesforce help to learn more about compact layouts . •
when browsing the list , it does n’t automatically update to show new , edited , and deleted events .
pull down on the list to refresh it . •
users ca n’t create new events from the list .
however , the new event publisher action allows users to add new events from a feed or a record view .
this action is automatically included in the publisher ’s global layout for organizations that are new as of summer ’14—see default event action lets users create events from any publisher on page 203 .
salesforce events are n’t currently available in the today app .
navigate task lists
more easily now when a user saves a task , the salesforce1 app displays the last viewed task list instead of the saved task record .
salesforce1 also now provides more confirmation messages about changes that users make .
finally , new and edited tasks appear in lists immediately after a user saves — a user no longer needs to tap refresh .
when a user creates a task while looking at a task list and then saves the task , the salesforce1 app displays the task list again , with the new task included .
if a task is displayed in a different list as a result of an edit , the salesforce1 app now displays a message .
for example , after a user closes a task while viewing the my tasks list , a message now confirms that the task appears in a different list ( closed tasks ) .
after a user reassigns a task to a user with different permissions , a message indicates that the user no longer has access to the task .
57 mobile salesforce1 enhancements log mobile calendar events in salesforce using today today displays events that are scheduled on users’ mobile calendars .
now today makes it fast and easy to log these events in salesforce .
this option is especially helpful if your organization requires sales reps to track customer interactions through salesforce events .
the option to log a mobile calendar event in salesforce is now available for every event in the today event list , allowing users to record each meeting as soon as it ends while all the details are still fresh .
the process takes just a few seconds because today automatically fills in all of the required standard fields with data from the mobile calendar .
no more typing or cutting - and - pasting required !
from the today event list , tap the event ’s card , then tap log this event .
this opens the publisher page for the new event publisher action .
( if your organization ’s global publisher layout includes multiple publisher actions for creating events , today uses the first action in the layout . )
to expedite the process , today uses data from the mobile calendar event to automatically populate these standard fields in the new salesforce event : assigned to , subject , start , end , location , description , and the all - day event checkbox ( if applicable ) .
the user can add other information of their own , including notes about the meeting .
note : if the event that is logged is one of a series of recurring events , “ recurring : ” is added to the text in the subject field .
only the current event is logged , not the full series of events .
after the event is logged in salesforce , the user can access the new salesforce event record directly from the mobile calendar event in today .
58 mobile salesforce1 enhancements if changes are made to a mobile calendar event after it ’s been logged in salesforce , the corresponding salesforce event is not automatically updated .
the user will need to update the event in salesforce .
add contacts to salesforce from today
it ’s no secret that using salesforce to gather information about customers helps sales reps build the insights needed to forge stronger relationships and win deals .
but often the trick is finding the time to sit down and enter new customer data .
today now makes it easy and fast for sales reps to add new contacts to salesforce , directly from a meeting ’s list of invitees .
when viewing an event in today , the invitees list includes avatars so users can tell at a glance which of the meeting ’s participants are already included in salesforce as contacts , person accounts , or users , and which ones are n’t .
for any invitee showing the unmatched ( ) avatar , simply tap on the person ’s name then tap create contact . 59 mobile salesforce1 enhancements today automatically fills in the new contact ’s email address , as well as their first and last name .
the user can add other information , including the contact ’s phone number .
note : if the invitee ’s name includes more than two words ( for example , john seymour smith ) , today adds the second name to the last name field .
the user may need to edit this field to correct the last name ( as in our example , to change “ seymour ” to “ smith ” ) .
if the event includes only a first or last name for the invitee , today does n’t populate either of the name fields .
see accounts related to events in today the crm data that ’s directly accessible from events viewed in today now includes related accounts , so users can quickly review important information like account details , pending opportunities , or open cases in advance of a meeting .
related accounts are listed in the new accounts card that ’s been added to the event record view .
( users must have the “
read ” user permission on accounts to this card . )
60 mobile salesforce1 enhancements today uses the accounts compact layout to determine the account details that are summarized in the accounts card .
( see the salesforce help to learn more about compact layouts . )
tap on an account summary to view the complete account record .
today determines that an account is related to an event if it ’s associated with a contact record that matches one of the meeting invitees .
person accounts are n’t included in this card .
if a meeting includes contacts from a variety of different accounts , today lists up to three accounts , picking those that are associated with the largest number of contacts .
to see how today chooses the most relevant related accounts for an event , consider a meeting that includes 10 invitees who are all contacts in salesforce , representing five different companies : • three contacts from petedge.com • three contacts from chewy , inc. • two contacts from pet food express • one contact from joe ’s pet supply • one contact from petopia the accounts card for this event will list petedge.com , chewy , inc. , and pet food express because petedge.com and chewy , inc. have three representatives each and pet food express has two representatives .
use today to join more types of conference calls , more quickly the conference call dialer in today has been improved so it ’s quicker and easier to join online meetings .
it ’s now completely automatic to join many citrix® gotomeeting® online meetings , and joining calls hosted by other conference providers , including webex® , intercall® , and microsoft® lync® , is much simpler .
the conference call dialer now functions the same way on android and ios devices .
61 mobile salesforce1 enhancements as in the previous release , the conference call dialer is available for an event if the mobile device supports making phone calls and if the event includes a valid conference call dial - in number .
but the other information that the dialer needs is much simpler now .
the dialer no longer requires that an event include an access code —
if one is n’t present , the dialer proceeds with calling in to the meeting and allows the user to manually enter the access code .
and today no longer requires specific labels to detect possible dial - in phone numbers or access codes .
these are the simplified dialer requirements : • the conference call invitation details must be included in the location field or the notes section of the event . •
the dialer supports local and international phone numbers that contain between 7 and 15 digits .
the phone number can be entered in any format . •
an access code must contain a minimum of seven numbers .
the conference call dialer automates as much of the dial - in process as possible .
the level of automation available depends on the conference call provider and the details included in the event . •
it ’s completely automatic to join a gotomeeting meeting if the event includes a valid gotomeeting url and a single valid dial - in phone number .
it ’s also automatic to join an online meeting from any provider if the event includes a dial - in number and an access code in this format :  < dial - in number>,,,<access code><other > , where < other > can include additional numbers , # symbols , commas , and asterisks .
the numbers must be entered on a single line and there ca n’t be any spaces after the first comma .
for example : 1234567890,,,1234567#11 #
in both of these cases , the user taps meeting . in the event , then taps call .
the dialer does everything else to connect to the •
it ’s slightly less automated to dial in to a gotomeeting event that includes multiple phone numbers , a gotomeeting event that does n’t include a meeting url , or an event hosted by a different conference provider .
before initiating the dial - in process , and depending on the information available in the event , the user may need to choose the dial - in phone number , the access code , or both , from the “
choose a phone number ” or “
choose an access code ” lists .
after the user taps call to start the dial - in process , today automatically dials the selected phone number .
when the conference provider prompts for the access code , the user taps dial “
< number > ” on their mobile device and today automatically enters the selected code .
note :  if today is n’t certain about what the meeting access code is , or if the meeting does n’t include an access code at all , the “
choose an access code ” list includes the skip this step option .
if the user selects this option , today dials the phone number only and the user can manually enter the access code and any other required information .
get weather information in today today now includes weather information .
this information helps users start the day right , from making wardrobe decisions to better anticipating commute or travel delays .
local weather information displays in the highlights area of the today event list .
users see an icon representing the daytime or nighttime weather forecast , and the forecast high and low temperature for the current location .
62 mobile salesforce1 enhancements to display local weather information , today requires access to location services on the mobile device .
new today users are prompted to grant location access ( along with calendar access ) when setting up today .
with summer ’14 , existing ios users will also be prompted to grant location access when they next access today .
users can control whether they view temperatures in celsius or fahrenheit , from the icon on the today event list .
63 mobile salesforce1 enhancements today user interface improvements the today interface has been streamlined , making it easier to scan and absorb important details .
improvements include : • a smaller highlights area at the top of the page so users can see more information about their actual events . •
the meeting organizer and invitees are now shown together in the invitees card . •
the second page in the record view was removed because it did n’t include any unique information .
drill down from a dashboard to a report users can now drill right to a report from a dashboard .
when viewing a dashboard in the salesforce1 app , just tap a dashboard component to see the report that ’s delivering the data to the dashboard .
dashboards available in : group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions reports available in : all editions except database.com reports can be viewed in tabular , summary , or top n format .
groupings in summary reports are shown as columns .
swipe right or left to see all the columns .
you can see a maximum of 100 records .
to see all records , log in to the full salesforce site .
important :  when you drill from a dashboard to a report , you may see slightly different data in the report view from what you saw in the dashboard view .
that ’s because the data displayed in a dashboard is from the last dashboard refresh ( the date and time of which are shown in the dashboard header ) , but drilling down to a report actually runs the report , so you are seeing the most current report data .
64 mobile salesforce1 enhancements drill
down from a report to a record tap a row in a report to see the specific record the report data is coming from .
dashboards available in : group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions reports available in : all editions except database.com sort data in reports dashboards available in : group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions reports available in : all editions except database.com focus on the information you want by arranging data in report columns .

when first viewed , the report is sorted the way it was sorted the last time it ran . •
tap a column for the first time and it ’s sorted smallest to largest for numerical values , or a to z for text .
• tap again to reverse that sort order . •
tap a third time to remove sorting and return to the way the report was originally sorted .

in organizations that had email - to - case enabled prior to summer ’14 , create a send email action from the case buttons , links , and actions page , and then add the action to the publisher on a case page layout .
in organizations that are created after or enable email - to - case after summer ’14 , once email - to - case is enabled , a send email action is automatically created and added to the list of available actions in the page layout editor .
to make the action available to users , add it to the publisher on a case page layout .
note :
on layouts where you can include the standard case feed email action — that is , on feed - based case page layouts if your organization has case feed actions and feed items enabled — you can add the send email action to the publisher and it will appear only in salesforce1 , not in the full salesforce site .
this helps prevent duplication —
agents wo n’t see two email - related actions in the publisher on case pages in the full site — and gives agents access to the more fully featured case feed email action in the full site .

73 mobile salesforce1 differences from the full salesforce site • reputation is n’t supported in salesforce1 .
however , if reputation is enabled and set up in the full site , users do accrue points when using salesforce1 .
for example , if the community manager set up a point system in the full site and assigned point values for writing a post and commenting on a post , then users in the community earn points with every post and comment made in salesforce1 .
users can view their points in the full site only though .
differences in using chatter in salesforce1 feeds •
it ’s now possible to search the main feed when using the salesforce1 app .
however , searching in feeds on user profiles , records , and public or private groups is n’t available .
topics in this release , you ca n’t : • edit topic details ( name and description ) • tag favorite topics • assign topics to feed posts or records • view records assigned to a topic • • • delete topics see these related lists : related topics , related groups , knowledgeable on topics , recent files see topics in auto - complete options when searching files in the salesforce1 mobile browser app : • high - volume portal users ca n’t access salesforce files from the salesforce1 navigation menu . •
files shared through accounts , cases , contacts and other objects do n't appear in the recently viewed files list view .
differences in finding information in salesforce1 while there haven’t been any changes to how global search works in the salesforce1 app , we want to clarify how users can quickly find what they need .
using global search in salesforce1 , users can find records for : items that administrators add to the salesforce1 navigation menu . •
• objects that users see in the recent section of the navigation menu .
these can be either : ◊ your users’ smart search items — the objects that users have viewed or worked with recently in the full salesforce site .
◊
for users who are new to salesforce and do n’t yet have a history of recent objects , a default set of objects .
as users work with records in the full salesforce site , those objects replace the default ones in the recent section and become the searchable objects in global search in salesforce1 .
tip :
it can take up to 15 days for objects users work with to appear in the recent section .
to make objects appear under recent sooner , they can pin them from the search results screen in the full salesforce site .
if objects are n’t yet available via global search in salesforce1 , users can select them from the navigation menu and then search for records for those objects using the record search box .
74 mobile salesforce1 differences from the full salesforce site differences in tracking your activities in salesforce1 events •
if the my events list contains all - day and time - based events , the order in which events are displayed in the list can be a little mixed up .
ordinarily all - day events are displayed at the top of the list but there can be cases where an all - day event for the next day winds up interspersed with time - based events for the current day . •
event detail pages do n’t display the recurrence or reminder sections . •
you ca n’t use the salesforce1 app to add events to microsoft® outlook®. tasks • group ( multi - user ) tasks are n’t available .
issues using today •
today uses the mobile device ’s time zone setting , while salesforce events respect the user ’s salesforce time zone setting .
if there ’s a difference between these settings when a user logs a mobile calendar event from today , the time field in the new salesforce event record reflects the user ’s salesforce time zone and does n’t match the time of the mobile calendar event . • because of the way that the android os identifies mobile calendar events , if a user accesses today on an android device to log a local event in salesforce , then views the same event in today on a different android device or an ios device , it may look like the event was n’t logged and it is n’t possible to access the corresponding salesforce event from today .
the logged event status and link is correct on the original android device , however . •
on devices running android 4.4 , weather information is always displayed in today , even if access to location information is disabled .
this is an android 4.4 issue and not something that today can control .

end of support for chatter mobile for blackberry and salesforce classic for blackberry
in case you missed the announcement last release , the chatter mobile for blackberry and salesforce classic for blackberry apps are no longer supported effective summer ’14 .
this is because the blackberry os platform on which these apps run is nearing the end of its lifecycle and the new blackberry 10 platform does n’t support these apps .
both of these apps will remain fully functional until they are officially deprecated .
users who have downloaded chatter mobile for blackberry or salesforce classic for blackberry on their devices can continue to use the apps .
however , salesforce.com is no longer providing support in the form of bug fixes or enhancements for any issues that your users might encounter .
chatter mobile for blackberry and salesforce classic for blackberry continue to be available for download at https://downloads.salesforce.com/bb .
we encourage all customers who use these apps to migrate to the salesforce1 app on any of its supported devices .
summer ’14 includes new blackberry support for the salesforce1 mobile browser app — see more browser and device support for the salesforce1 mobile browser app on page 47 .
to get started on salesforce1 , see the salesforce help . 78 mobile configure push notifications for your salesforce mobile sdk connected apps ( generally available ) configure push notifications for your salesforce mobile sdk connected apps ( generally available ) we ’ve expanded connected app settings to support mobile push notifications .
with these mobile app settings , developers of salesforce mobile sdk connected apps can configure their users’ mobile devices to receive push notifications from salesforce .
if you provide a native mobile sdk app for your organization , you can use the new mobile push notifications feature to alert your users to important changes and events in your business .
the mobile push notifications feature supports android and ios devices and requires additional configuration : • with the mobile os provider ( apple or google ) • •
in your mobile sdk app in apex , using the new messaging .
pushnotification and messaging .
pushnotificationpayload classes or with the chatter rest api , using the new push notifications resource in addition , we ’ve provided a push notification test page .
in this page , you can quickly test your push notification setup before the feature goes live in your mobile app .
to reach the test page : 1 .
in setup , go to create > apps .
2 . click the name of your connected app .
3 . click send test notification next to supported push platform .
this link appears only if you ’ve configured your connected app to support mobile push notifications .
see the salesforce mobile push notifications implementation guide ( available with the summer ‘ 14 release ) for full configuration details .
until then , you can download the pdf file at http://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/salesforce_mobile_push_notifications_implementation-2.pdf .
note :  push notifications for connected apps are available only for custom mobile connected apps , such as mobile sdk apps .
this feature does not apply to salesforce1 or salesforcea apps .
push notification limits the maximum number of push notifications that are allowed for each mobile application associated with your salesforce organization depends on the type of application .
maximum number of push notifications allowed for limit mobile applications provided by salesforce ( for example , salesforce1 ) mobile applications developed by your organization for internal employee usage mobile applications installed from the appexchange 50,000 notifications per app per day 35,000 notifications per app per day 5,000 notifications per app per day 79 mobile check the push notification service type only deliverable notifications count toward this limit .
for example , consider the scenario where a notification is sent to 1,000 employees in your company , but 100 employees haven’t installed the mobile application yet .
only the notifications sent to the 900 employees who have installed the mobile application count toward this limit .
each test push notification that is generated through the test push notification page is limited to a single recipient .
test push notifications count toward an application ’s daily push notification limit .
you can make up to 10 push notification method calls in each apex transaction , and send up to 2000 notifications in every method call .
check the push notification service type use the push_service_type response value in the identity url response to check if your connected app supports push notifications .
this response value is set to apple if the connected app is registered with apple push notification service ( apns ) for ios push notifications , or androidgcm if it ’s registered with google cloud messaging ( gcm ) for android push notifications .
the response value type is an array .
package mobile connected apps ( generally available ) mobile packaging is now available to all customers for free .
mobile packaging solves the app distribution problem for customers building mobile apps on the salesforce platform , by providing an easy mechanism for distributing those apps to employees or partners .
connected apps can be created in : group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions connected apps can be installed in : all editions to read : user permissions needed “ customize application ”
to create , update , or delete : “ customize application ” and either to update all fields except profiles , permission sets , and service provider saml attributes : to update profiles , permission sets , and service provider saml attributes : “ modify all data ” or “ manage connected apps ” “ customize application ”
“ customize application ” and “ modify all data ”
to uninstall : “ download appexchange packages ”
when creating a mobile connected app , you can specify a set of mobile packaging attributes , such as the platform , version , form factor , and mobile app binary file .
if you then include the mobile connected app as a component when creating a package , these attributes are included in the package and migrated when a user moves a package from one organization to another .
in addition , after you create and package a mobile connected app , it ’s instantly available for distribution via a listing in the private appexchange .
here are the steps for creating a mobile connected app . 1 .
from setup , click create > apps .
80 mobile package mobile connected apps ( generally available ) 2 .
in the connected apps section , click new .
3 .
enter the relevant information in the basic information , api ( enable oauth ) , and web app settings sections .
4 .
enter the following information in the mobile app settings section .
a. select pin protect , if your app supports pin protection .
this gives an administrator the option of setting the session timeout and pin length for mobile applications after installing the connected app .
pin protection is automatically supported by the salesforce mobile sdk ( https://developer.salesforce.com/page/mobile_sdk ) .
you can also implement it manually by reading the mobile_policy object from the user ’s identity url .
b. specify the app platform by choosing ios or android from the drop - down list .
c. specify the supported device form factor(s ) for the mobile app from the restrict to device type drop - down list .
the possible values are phone , tablet , or mini - tablet .
if the app is universal ( that is , supports all form factors ) , do n’t choose any value .
d. enter the app version number of the mobile app .
e. enter the minimum os version required for the app .
f. select private app to confirm this app is for internal ( non - public ) distribution only .
this is required because apple does n’t allow distribution of public mobile apps outside of its app store .
g. if the mobile app is private , specify the location of the mobile app binary file .
this is an ipa file for ios and an apk file for android .
h. for ios apps only : i. specify the location of the application icon .
this is the icon displayed during download and installation of the app on an ios device .
ii . specify the ios bundle identifier .
note :
for ios 7 and higher , you must specify the same bundle identifier that you used for developing the app in xcode .
otherwise , the end user will see two app icons on app installation . i. if the mobile connected app is a public app and you haven’t uploaded its binary file to salesforce , enter the app binary url here . 5 .
click save .
you can now publish your app , make further edits , or delete it .
note :  if you remove mobile integration from a new version of an existing connected app , mobile integration is no longer included in any version of the connected app .
for example , imagine publishing a package containing version 1.0 of your connected app with mobile integration .
then remove mobile integration from the app , repackage it , and publish it as version 1.1 .
if a customer installs the earlier package with version 1.0 at this point , the version 1.0 connected app will not contain mobile integration .

stream.co.jp
stream.ne.jp
the previews are powered by embed.ly , a third - party service , and include thumbnails , descriptions , and video players for links to videos .
we do n’t share any content , user , organization , or account data with embed.ly .
we only share the urls that are on the domain whitelist .
additionally , all of our url requests pass through a salesforce proxy , meaning embed.ly never receives calls directly from the client and therefore does n’t have information about who 's making the url request .

102 communities dashboards for community managers

as your business changes , you can easily modify the flow to accommodate your new process and data requirements .
these flow templates retrieve selected data from the opportunity or quote and account that ’s used to create the orders and order products .
depending on the template you use , the flow could also create a contract and relate it to the opportunity or quote .
the flow creates an order , looks up the opportunity products or quote line items , and creates an order product for each line .
you can modify one or more of these templates to : • retrieve additional fields from other objects and map them to fields on the contract , order , or order products being created . •
• create records for other objects and relate them to the newly created records .
include or exclude certain opportunity products or quote lines to be used for generating order products .

note :
next - gen knowledge search is currently available through a pilot program .
contact salesforce.com to enable this feature for your organization .
take advantage of these improvements and new search capabilities . •
faster indexing means it takes less time for records to be searchable after they 're created or updated . •
improved alphanumeric search means more relevant search results .
we now handle punctuation more efficiently , so that it ’s easier for the search engine to recognize when a user is searching for specialized strings such as urls , email addresses , and phone numbers . 169 service search synonym groups more easily •
improved tokenization also means more relevant search results .
the search engine breaks down all searchable text into smaller pieces , or tokens , at meaningful boundaries ( spaces , punctuation , and alphanumeric ) and stores them in the search index .
proper tokenization is essential for accurate search results in any language , and especially so for east asian languages that are written without spaces between words , such as chinese , japanese , korean , and thai ( cjkt ) .
for these languages , morphological tokenization replaces the more simplistic bigram tokenization and reduces the number of non - meaningful tokens indexed .
• organizations searching in cjkt languages are uniquely affected .
besides tokenization , we 've enhanced punctuation handling and added support for stemming .
• enable the option to change the default search operator from or to and .
matching on all terms in the user ’s query tends to produce more relevant search results .
warning :  enabling the default and operator means that multi - term synonyms are no longer supported .
if your organization has defined multi - term synonyms , they will be ignored and excluded from search results . •
if your organization has enabled synonyms : ◊ use synonymdictionary components in the metadata api to manage synonym groups .
optimize search results for acronyms , variations of product names , and other terminology unique to your organization .
◊ enable the option to perform synonym matching for search queries that include trailing wildcards .
for example , if you 've defined a synonym group containing the terms bill and invoice , a search for bill * returns matches for bill , billing ( wildcard expansion ) , and invoice ( synonym matching ) .
search synonym groups

custom permissions ( developer preview ) use custom permissions to give users access to custom processes or apps .
available in : developer edition 192 force.com customization create custom permissions note :  custom permissions are currently available as a developer preview ; they ’re available only in developer edition organizations .
in salesforce , many features require access checks that specify which users can access certain functions .
permission set and profiles settings include built - in access settings for many entities , like objects , fields , tabs , and visualforce pages .
however , permission sets and profiles do n't include access for some custom processes and apps .
for example , for a time - off manager app , all users might need to be able to submit time - off requests but only a smaller set of users need to approve time - off requests .
you can use custom permissions for these types of controls .
custom permissions let you define access checks that can be assigned to users via permission sets or profiles , similar to how you assign user permissions and other access settings .
for example , you can define access checks in apex that make a button on a visualforce page available only if a user has the appropriate custom permission .
you can query custom permissions in these ways . •
to determine which users have access to a specific custom permission , use salesforce object query language ( soql ) with the setupentityaccess and custompermission sobjects .
•
to determine what custom permissions users have when they authenticate in a connected app , reference the user 's identity url , which salesforce provides along with the access token for the connected app .
using oauth requests , you can retrieve custom permissions associated with a connected app for an organization , and information on whether a user has associated permissions enabled .
for more information , see get custom permissions in the identity url response on page 228 .
note : • custom permissions are n’t available in unmanaged packages . •
custom permissions are n't included in profile settings for packages . •
if you deploy a change set with a custom permission that includes a connected app , the connected app must already be installed in the destination organization .

more specific permissions for managing users we 've added more specific user - management permissions that distribute the access of the “ manage users ” permission .
now organizations have more precise control over what user - management permissions their administrators have .
available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions the “ manage users ” permission gives access to many user - management tasks , such as managing profiles , permission sets , roles , and password policies .
you might need to give users access to some , but not all , of those tasks .
for example , some users might need to manage profiles and permission sets but not to deactivate users .
to improve the control over user management permissions , we ’ve added the following permissions .
permission name “ assign permission sets ” “ manage internal users ”
“ manage ip addresses ” “ manage login access policies ” “ manage password policies ”
allows users to assign permission sets to users and remove permission set assignments .
create and edit internal users .
create , edit , and delete trusted ip ranges .
specify the login access policies that apply to administrators and support organizations .
set password restrictions and login lockout policies for all users .
“ manage profiles and permission sets ” create , edit , and delete profiles and permission sets . “
manage sharing ”
“ manage roles ”
create , edit , and recalculate sharing rules , and edit organization - wide defaults .
create , edit , and delete roles .
the “ manage users ” permission still exists and provides the same access that it has provided in earlier releases .
when “
manage users ” is enabled , these new permissions are also automatically enabled .
198 force.com customization customize feed - based page layouts in new ways customize feed - based page layouts in new ways expand the feed horizontally and automatically collapse the publisher when it ’s not in use so users can see more information at a glance when they work with records .
two new settings for feed - based page layouts let you customize feed views so users can see more information without having to scroll .
• use the auto - collapse publisher setting to collapse the publisher when it ’s not in use .
the publisher expands to its regular height when a user clicks inside it .
figure 5 : collapsible publisher • enable the use full - width feed setting to expand the feed horizontally to take up all available space on the page .
note :  this setting applies only when users view records on tabs or subtabs in the salesforce console .
the portion of the page the feed takes up with this setting enabled depends on whether you have tools or components in the right column of the page layout , and whether you have console sidebar components .

all custom objects classified as light or enterprise objects to enable either of these settings , click feed view in the top menu of the page layout editor when you ’re editing a feed - based page layout , and then choose the setting you want .
both of these settings are automatically enabled in organizations created after summer ’14 .
for more information about feed - based layouts , see “ feed - based layouts overview ” in the salesforce help .
all custom objects classified as light or enterprise objects every custom object is now classified based on whether you can use a private sharing model , bulk api , or streaming api with it .
when you create custom objects , you can classify the object as a light application object or an enterprise application object by enabling or disabling the following settings .
• allow sharing • allow bulk api access • allow streaming api access if these settings are enabled on an object , it ’s an enterprise application object .
if these settings are disabled on an object , it ’s a light application object .
the settings must all be enabled or all be disabled .
objects created before summer ’14 automatically have these settings enabled and are classified as enterprise application objects .
if your organization uses force.com light app or force.com enterprise app licenses , use these object classifications to verify that your organization is following the contractual limits of those licenses .

home page components we made some significant changes to how html code is handled in home page components .
we also introduced a new visualforce area home page component .
new rich text editor for html area home page components we replaced the rich text editor in html area home page components with a new version that supports more markup but does n’t allow html to be manually entered .
new html area home page components will use the new rich text editor .
html area home page components created prior to summer ’14 that contain simple markup that is supported by the new rich text editor will appear in the new editor .
201 force.com customization actions html area home page components that were created prior to summer ’14 that contain code that ’s no longer supported for html components , such as javascript and iframes , will continue to work and will still use the old rich text editor ( see note below ) .
important :  in summer ’15 we will start removing unsupported code from html area home page components .
as a result , components that contain javascript , css , iframes , or other unsupported markup might stop working properly .
to use javascript or other advanced html elements in your home page component , we recommend that you use a visualforce area component instead .
increased validation for image and html area home page components if you create or edit an image home page component that contains unsupported html markup , all unsupported markup is removed upon saving .
the new rich text editor for html components does n’t allow you to enter unsupported markup .
existing html home page components with unsupported markup will continue to work until summer ’15 , per the previous note .
new visualforce area home page component the new visualforce area home page component lets you create home page components with custom markup , including javascript and css , which are now restricted from use in html area home page components .
use visualforce area home page components to add dynamic content to your home page .
for example , you can present content from partner apps , display charts in conjunction with the analytics api , or add a canvas app to the home page .
visualforce area home page components can be added to the narrow or the wide column of the home page layout , and the referenced visualforce page can use a standard or custom controller .
you can include javascript in your visualforce page , but because the component is rendered in an iframe on the home page layout , the javascript ca n’t interact with the page that contains the component .
actions we ’ve made some changes to the way actions work in salesforce and salesforce1 .
global publisher layouts and global actions have new locations in setup removing actions’ dependence on chatter means that we needed to rearrange things in setup .
changes to mobile smart actions behavior mobile smart actions no longer automatically display in salesforce1 .
default event action lets users create events from any publisher we ’ve added a create action for events to the default actions on the global publisher layout .
now users can create events on the home tab , the chatter tab , and record detail pages , without administrator setup .
202 force.com customization actions default action lets users ask questions in chatter we ’ve added a new default action for questions .

global actions are now located in setup at create > global actions > actions .
global publisher layouts can now be found in setup at create > global actions > publisher layouts .
changes to mobile smart actions behavior mobile smart actions no longer automatically display in salesforce1 .
if your organization existed prior to winter ’14 , and it had chatter enabled but did n’t have publisher actions enabled when winter ’14 was released , mobile smart actions were automatically displayed in salesforce1 on the feed page and on account , contact , lead , opportunity , and case records .
however , with summer ’14 , mobile smart actions are no longer automatically displayed .
in summer ’14 , publisher actions are enabled for all organizations that have chatter enabled , but nonstandard actions —
actions other than post , file , link , poll , and thanks — aren’t added to organizations that did n’t have publisher actions enabled previously .
if you disable publisher actions , and you want mobile smart actions on your page layouts , you need to add the mobile smart actions element manually .
however , we recommend that you create your own actions or customize the default actions instead .
mobile smart actions display the full edit form based on the object ’s page layout , while actions that you create can be optimized for mobile use .
default event action lets users create events from any publisher we ’ve added a create action for events to the default actions on the global publisher layout .
now users can create events on the home tab , the chatter tab , and record detail pages , without administrator setup .

default workflow user is notified when email alerts approach or exceed limits when workflow email alerts approach or exceed certain limits , salesforce sends a warning email to the default workflow user or — if the default workflow user is n't set — to an active system administrator . •
verify formula references to custom fields in workflow rule criteria and workflow actions 205 force.com customization business logic and process automation
previously , when an object had two custom fields with the same name — one with a namespace prefix ( abc__expense__c ) and one without ( expense__c)—formulas in workflow rule criteria and workflow actions that reference the custom field without the namespace prefix would incorrectly access the custom field with the namespace prefix . •
increased limits for total rules
the limits for the total number of rules were raised .
approvals • expanded approval history reports you can now run reports on completed and in - progress approval processes and their steps .
previously , reports were available only for pending approval requests .
we also made more fields and objects that contain approval history data available via soql queries .
• submit records for approval from within the salesforce1 app users can now submit records for approval from the salesforce1 app .
• submit records for approval from a flow ( pilot ) you can now submit records for approval from a flow .
because approval processes are fully configured in salesforce , you only need to identify the id of the record that you want to submit .
optionally , you can add submission comments .
visual workflow • changes to trigger - ready flows a trigger - ready flow is a flow that can be launched without user interaction .
formerly available only via a pilot program for launching flows from workflow rules , there are new methods of launching a trigger - ready flow .
we ’ve also updated the list of elements and resources that trigger - ready flows can contain . •
manipulate multiple salesforce fields and records at one time in a flow ( generally available ) collect the values for multiple fields for salesforce records with a single query , and manipulate that data with a single dml statement by using sobject variables , sobject collection variables , and loops in a flow .
in spring ’14 , this functionality was available only with a pilot program . •
cross - object field references in flows when building a flow , you can now reference fields for records that are related to the values that are stored in an sobject variable .
to do so , you must manually enter the references .
you can reference cross - object fields to use their values anywhere you can reference a flow resource or enter a value . • use an object - specific or global action in a flow as an alternative to record or fast elements , flows can now use object - specific and global actions to create and update salesforce records .
set the input assignments to transfer data from the flow to the action . •
send email from a flow you now have two options for sending email from a flow : call an existing workflow email alert or configure the email within the flow .
• submit records for approval from a flow ( pilot ) 206 force.com customization workflow target user merge fields for email templates ( beta ) you can now submit records for approval from a flow . because approval processes are fully configured in salesforce , you only need to identify the id of the record that you want to submit .
optionally , you can add submission comments .
• governor limits enforced on all flows previously , flows could potentially consume more resources than are allowed by our governor limits , such as the number of dml statements or soql queries issued in a single transaction .
create , update , and delete elements issue dml statements , and lookup elements issue soql queries .
this critical update more strictly enforces governor limits on flows .
• flow formulas can resolve to non - numeric values formula resources in flows no longer need to return a numeric value . •
date / time values in the cloud flow designer include gmt offset at runtime , time zones for date / time values may differ from what you see in the cloud flow designer .
during runtime , date / time values reflect the running user 's time zone settings in salesforce .
in the cloud flow designer , date / time values reflect the time zone set on your computer .
for your reference , the cloud flow designer appends the gmt offset to your date / time value .
submit records for approval from a flow ( pilot ) you can now submit records for approval from a flow .
because approval processes are fully configured in salesforce , you only need to identify the id of the record that you want to submit .
optionally , you can add submission comments .
workflow target user merge fields for email templates ( beta ) workflow email alerts for the user object can reference fields from the user record that triggered the workflow rule .
when creating or editing email templates in salesforce , the select field type drop - down list now contains the workflow target user option .
note :  this release contains a beta version of workflow on the user object that is production quality but has known limitations .
to provide feedback and suggestions , go to ideaexchange .
to use merge fields from user records in email templates , select from the following merge field types : • user fields — use these merge fields to represent the sending user .
merge fields named { !
user.field_name } return values from the user record of the person who created or updated the record that triggered the workflow rule .
• workflow target user fields — use these merge fields only in email templates for workflow rules on the user object .
merge fields named { !
target_user.field_name } return values from the user record that was created or updated to trigger the workflow rule .
for example , if you have a workflow rule that emails new employees when their user records are created , you could use the following email template to reference both the name of the employee and the person who created the user record .
207 force.com customization default workflow user is notified when email alerts approach or exceed limits default workflow user is notified when email alerts approach or exceed limits when workflow email alerts approach or exceed certain limits , salesforce sends a warning email to the default workflow user or — if the default workflow user is n't set — to an active system administrator .

similar to { ! this } , { !
old } can be assigned only to sobject variables . •
unlike { ! this } , { ! old } ca n’t be selected by clicking .
you must manually enter { !
old } in the value column .
a flow that is launched by a flow trigger workflow action can now easily access both the current and most recent previous values of the record that was edited to cause the workflow rule to fire .
the flow just needs two sobject variables that have : • • the same object type as the flow trigger the input / output type set to allow input access when setting those sobject variables from the flow trigger : • enter { ! this } to specify the current values of the record that was edited to cause the workflow rule to fire . •
enter { !
old } to specify the record ’s values from immediately before it was edited to cause the workflow rule to fire .
if the record was newly created , { !

expanded approval history reports you can now run reports on completed and in - progress approval processes and their steps .
previously , reports were available only for pending approval requests .
we also made more fields and objects that contain approval history data available via soql queries .
note :  after summer ’14 is available for your organization , it may take a few weeks before your organization ’s approval history data becomes available .
during those initial weeks , approval history reports may not return all possible data .
also , some data from previously completed and currently pending approval processes may never be reflected in the approval history .
for details , see considerations for approval history reports on page 212 .
you can now create a custom report type with primary object process instance and related object process instance node .
a process instance represents one instance of an approval process .
a new process instance is created each time a record is submitted for approval .
a process instance node represents an instance of an approval step .
a new process instance node is created each time a record enters a step in an approval process .
no process instance node is created when the record does n’t meet the step criteria or if the approval process instance is otherwise completed without entering the step .
after you create the custom report type , you can create and run approval history reports .
for example , use approval history reports to : • • • see how long ( maximum , minimum , or average time ) it takes for your users to complete an approval process or a particular step in an approval process .
see all pending approval process instances with a view of which ones are waiting at a specific approval step .
see all approval processes that were completed for an object or a specific record , and filter the results for a specific range of dates .
additional details — such as specific approval requests that are made within each approval step — are available via soql queries of the following objects .
( you can even create a visualforce page or other custom ui to act as a management console for approvals in your organization . )
• processdefinition • processinstance • processinstancehistory • processinstancenode • processinstancestep 210 force.com customization expanded approval history reports •
processinstanceworkitem • processnode report example : approval steps — elapsed times this sample report displays all approval process instances ( 1 ) and groups results by approval process name ( 2 ) and record name ( 3 ) .
the results are sorted by step name ( 4 ) and include step status ( 5 ) , step start date ( 6 ) , step elapsed minutes ( 7 ) , step completed date ( 8) , and approval process instance id ( 9 ) .
notice that the previous sample report does n't include the approvers for each step and the elapsed time for each approval request .
to get this information , you need to run a soql query by using the approval process instance id from the report .
211 force.com customization expanded approval history reports the following sample soql query obtains the actorid ( user or queue that received the approval request ) and the elapsedtimeinhours ( elapsed time since the approval request was sent ) for the first pending step in the report .
select actorid , elapsedtimeinhours from processinstanceworkitem where processinstanceid = ' 04gd0000000lviv ' the sample query has only one result , and you can view that approver 's user profile page by appending the resulting actorid to the organization 's base url ( https://mycompany.salesforce.com/005d00000015vggiay ) , which gets redirected to the user profile page .

changes to trigger - ready flows a trigger - ready flow is a flow that can be launched without user interaction .
formerly available only via a pilot program for launching flows from workflow rules , there are new methods of launching a trigger - ready flow .
we ’ve also updated the list of elements and resources that trigger - ready flows can contain .
new methods of launching trigger - ready flows you can now launch a trigger - ready flow with these new methods , which are generally available . •
the apex start ( ) method • a custom button or link •

updated run restrictions a trigger - ready flow can now contain apex plug - in elements , but it can no longer contain choice or dynamic choice resources .
here ’s a full list of the elements and resources that are n’t supported in trigger - ready flows .
• choice resources • dynamic choice resources • • screen elements step elements run restrictions are now determined by the flow ’s active version — or the latest version , if there ’s no active version .
if the active or latest version includes restricted elements or resources , that flow is not trigger - ready and it has a run restriction 214 force.com customization manipulate multiple salesforce fields and records at one time in a flow ( generally available ) of “
no triggers ” .
if the active or latest version does n’t include any restricted elements or resources , the flow is trigger - ready and it has no run restrictions .
manipulate multiple salesforce fields and records at one time in a flow ( generally available ) collect the values for multiple fields for salesforce records with a single query , and manipulate that data with a single dml statement by using sobject variables , sobject collection variables , and loops in a flow .
in spring ’14 , this functionality was available only with a pilot program .
dml statements make changes to the salesforce database by adding , updating , or deleting records .
for information about the per - transaction limits for dml statements and queries , see “ understanding execution governors and limits ” in the force.com apex code developer ’s guide .
store multiple field values for a salesforce record in one variable .
an sobject variable is a container that can store values for multiple fields for a single salesforce record .
previously , you had to use one flow variable for each individual field value that you want to store .
store multiple field values for multiple salesforce records in one variable .
an sobject collection variable is a container for an ordered group of related items .
an individual item in a collection is similar to an sobject variable , as it contains the field values for one salesforce record .
to store field values in an sobject collection variable , use a fast lookup element .
for example , if you create an account - based collection and your query returns three records , the collection contains three items .
the first item in the collection contains field values from the first account returned , the second item contains the second account record ’s values , and so on .
previously , you had to use one flow variable for each individual field value that you want to store .
use a single query to look up multiple field values .
the new fast lookup element uses a single query to obtain multiple field values for one salesforce record ( when storing values in an sobject variable ) or multiple salesforce records ( when storing values in an sobject collection variable ) .
previously , you had to obtain field values using record lookup elements .
a record lookup element uses one variable for each individual field value that you want to store .
to store field values for multiple records with record lookup elements , you must use one record lookup element for each individual record .
use a single dml statement and a single variable to create salesforce records .
the new fast create element adds records to the salesforce database by using the field values stored in an sobject variable ( one record ) or sobject collection variable ( one or more records ) .
for example , when you use a fast create element that references an sobject collection , the flow creates one record for each item in the collection .
previously , you had to use a record create element to create salesforce records from a flow .
with a record create element , you can create only one record at a time and you must identify the fields and their values individually .
use a single dml statement and a single variable to update , or delete salesforce records .
the new fast update and fast delete elements make changes to the salesforce database by using the field values stored in an sobject variable ( one record ) or sobject collection variable ( one or more records ) .
for example , when you use a fast delete element that references an sobject collection , the flow deletes all the records whose ids are stored in the collection . 215 force.com customization manipulate multiple salesforce fields and records at one time in a flow ( generally available )
previously , you had to use record update and record delete elements to update or delete salesforce records from a flow .
with a record update element , you can update multiple records at a time , but you must identify the fields and their values individually .
whereas each record update and record delete element uses one query and one dml statement , each fast update and fast delete element uses only one dml statement .
with fast elements , you can combine the results of multiple queries and perform a single dml statement against those results rather than performing a dml statement for every query .
examine the values for a collection of salesforce records .
a loop examines each item in a collection and executes actions on them based on the elements in the flow .
for each item that the loop examines , the item ’s field values are copied into an sobject variable , which you identify when you create the loop .
the elements within the loop can examine and update the contents of the sobject variable — not the collection item itself .
you ca n’t update items in a collection .
however , as the loop iterates through each collection item , the loop can modify the data in the loop variable .
the loop can then add the contents of the loop variable to a new collection before moving on to the next item .
to add items to an existing collection , use an assignment element .
if you populate an existing sobject collection variable by using a fast lookup or record lookup element , all the previous collection items are deleted and replaced by the new items , even if they contain completely different fields .
you ca n’t remove items from an existing collection .
instead , loop through the collection and add the items you want to keep to a new collection .
use a decision element to differentiate between the items you want to add to the new collection and the items you do n’t want to add to the new collection .
to try out these new elements and resources , from setup click create > workflow & approvals > flows and open a new or existing flow .
changes since spring ’14 sobject variables , sobject collection variables , fast lookup / create / update / delete elements , and loop elements were formerly available through a pilot program .
here ’s what ’s changed since then . •
these elements and resources are now available in all flows .
in spring ’14 , they were available only in trigger - ready flows . •
values for sobject variables and sobject collection variables can be set or retrieved through visualforce and apex .
these values can not be set through url parameters .
sample flow that loops through a collection this example demonstrates how to use sobject collection variables and a loop to transfer ownership of accounts from one user to another .
the flow already has the required user ids .
first , create an account - based sobject collection variable called collacctjsmith and populate it with all account records that john smith owns .
then create a loop that iterates through the collection .
for each item in the collection , the loop does the following : 1 . assigns the collection item to the loop variable
. 2 . evaluates whether or not the account has more than 10,000 employees . 3 .
assigns madison ’s user id to the ownerid field in the loop variable if the account has more than 10,000 employees . 4 .
assigns amber ’s user id to the ownerid field in the loop variable if the account does n’t have more than 10,000 employees . 5 .
adds the loop variable ’s values as a new item in a second collection called collreassignedaccts . 216 force.com customization cross - object field references in flows finally , create a fast update element to update the accounts in collreassignedaccts with the new ownerid after the loop finishes iterating through the collection .
this section of the flow uses a single query to look up the list of accounts and a single dml statement to update those accounts .
if you created a similar flow by using record update elements , you would use : • one record update element to find all accounts that were owned by john and had more than 10,000 employees ( 1 query ) and then update those records’ ownerid to madison ’s i d ( 1 dml statement ) . •
one record update element to find all accounts that were owned by john and did n’t have more than 10,000 employees ( 1 query ) and then update those records’ ownerid to amber ’s i d ( 1 dml statement ) .
cross - object field references in flows when building a flow , you can now reference fields for records that are related to the values that are stored in an sobject variable .
to do so , you must manually enter the references .
you can reference cross - object fields to use their values anywhere you can reference a flow resource or enter a value .
implementation tips if a flow interview encounters a null value at any point in the cross - object expression , the element containing the reference fails .
the reference runs successfully if the last field value in the expression is null .
for example , if you store a contact in { ! sobjcontact } and try to reference { ! sobjcontact}.account .
name , the flow will fail if accountid on the stored contact is null ( because there is n’t an account to look at ) , but it wo n’t fail if name on the related account is null .
if an element contains a cross - object reference that fails and the element does n’t have a fault path defined , the entire interview fails .
to avoid this , you can : • make the fields that you want to reference in the expression required in salesforce .
for example , for the expression { ! sobjcontact}.account .
name , you could require accountid on contact page layouts .
then use another flow to find any records with null values for that field and update them . • determine whether each field that ’s referenced in the expression has a value by using the wasset operator in a decision element .
cross - object field references in flows do n’t count against your organization ’s limits for : 217 force.com customization cross - object field references in flows • cross - object relationships per object • dml operations per transaction syntax to reference a field on a related record , use this syntax . { !
sobjectvariable.objectname1.objectname2.fieldname } where : • • • • sobjectvariable is the unique name for the sobject variable that you want to start from .
objectname1 is the api name for an object that 's related to sobjectvariable 's object type .
the api names for all custom objects end in _ _
r .
( optional ) objectname2 is the api name for an object that 's related to objectname1 .
your expression must include at least one object name , but you can add more objects as needed .
fieldname is the name for the field that you want to reference on the last object in the expression .
the api names for all custom fields end in _ _ c .
for example , { ! sov_contact .
account .
id } references i d of the account that 's related to the contact record represented by an sobject variable in the flow .
when you create an sobject variable from which you plan to reference fields on related records , you must store the id field value for the first related record in the sobject variable .
for example , if you want to reference an opportunity ’s contract , you must store contractid in the sobject variable or add a value for contractid by using an assignment element .
for example , to update a contract ’s owner to be the contract ’s account ’s owner : 1 .
use a fast lookup element to store the contract ’s fields , including accountid , in an sobject variable called varcontract . 2 .
use a decision element to verify that the value of accountid was set in varcontract .
218 force.com customization send email from a flow 3 .
use a fast lookup to store the fields for the contract ’s account , including ownerid , in another sobject variable called varaccount .
4 .
use a decision element to confirm that the value of ownerid was set in varaccount .
5 .
use an assignment element to specify { ! varcontract .
account .
ownerid } as the value for 6 .
use a fast update element to write the values in varcontract , including the updated ownerid value , to the contract { !
varcontract .
ownerid}. in salesforce .
send email from a flow you now have two options for sending email from a flow : call an existing workflow email alert or configure the email within the flow .
with an email alert element , you only need to associate the email with a record .
workflow email alerts are configured in salesforce , and they already have a set email template , list of recipients , and sender .
the palette displays each workflow email alert that exists in your organization .
with the send email element , you need to provide the subject , body , list of recipients , and sender for the email .

3 . drag the email element that you want onto the canvas , and fill in the general settings and input parameters .
submit records for approval from a flow ( pilot ) you can now submit records for approval from a flow .
because approval processes are fully configured in salesforce , you only need to identify the id of the record that you want to submit .
optionally , you can add submission comments .
note :  submit for approval actions in a flow are currently available through the “
launch flows from workflow rules ” pilot program .
for information on enabling this feature in your organization , contact salesforce.com .
if a flow submits a record for approval , the user who launched the flow is the submitter .
if a workflow rule triggers a flow that submits a record for approval , the user who triggered the workflow rule ( by creating or editing a record ) is the submitter .
when the record is approved or rejected , the user who launched the flow or triggered the workflow rule is notified .
this action call succeeds only for approval processes where the approver on submit is determined automatically and the user who launched the flow is an allowed initial submitter on the approval process that runs .
if the executed approval process 219 force.com customization use an object - specific or global action in a flow requires the submitter to manually chose the approver or if the user who launches the flow is n’t an allowed initial submitter on the approval process that runs , the flow interview fails and the user who launched the flow sees an error .

we recommend that you activate this update now and test your flows to identify any that violate the governor limits .
if you encounter any errors , you can deactivate this update , modify the flows so that they do n’t violate the limits , and then reactivate the update .
to modify your flows to be more efficient : • you can examine dml statements and soql queries throughout your flow and determine whether you could combine multiple operations into fewer create , update , delete , and lookup elements .
for example , if your flow updates a field on a record and later updates another field on that record , consider whether you could update both fields simultaneously within the same record update or fast update element . •
you can also perform one dml statement or soql query on multiple records by using an sobject collection variable with a fast create , fast lookup , fast update , or fast delete element .
for more information about the governor limits , see “ understanding execution governors and limits ” in the force.com apex code developer ’s guide .
other business logic and process automation changes there are other important enhancements to workflow , approvals , and visual workflow .
verify formula references to custom fields in workflow rule criteria and workflow actions
previously , when an object had two custom fields with the same name — one with a namespace prefix ( abc__expense__c ) and one without ( expense__c)—formulas in workflow rule criteria and workflow actions that reference the custom field without the namespace prefix would incorrectly access the custom field with the namespace prefix .
now these formulas reference the correct custom fields , but this correction may change the behavior of your workflow rules and actions — for both workflow rules and approval processes .
we strongly recommend that you check all formulas in your workflow rules and actions for any references to custom fields that need a namespace prefix .
specifically , for each formula reference to a custom field : 1 . verify that no other custom fields for the same object have the same name .
2 .
if other custom fields have the same name , determine which one is the correct custom field for the formula to reference .
3 . if the correct custom field has a namespace , make sure the formula reference includes that namespace .
increased limits for total rules
the limits for the total number of rules were raised : • from 300 to 500 per object • from 1,000 to 2,000 per organization these limits apply to any combination of active and inactive workflow , assignment , auto - response , and escalation rules .
important :  the limit for active rules hasn't changed and remains at 50 rules per object .
flow formulas can resolve to non - numeric values formula resources in flows no longer need to return a numeric value .
the following data types are supported . •
boolean • currency 221 force.com customization security •
date • date / time • number • text date / time values in the cloud flow designer include gmt offset at runtime , time zones for date / time values may differ from what you see in the cloud flow designer .
during runtime , date / time values reflect the running user 's time zone settings in salesforce .
in the cloud flow designer , date / time values reflect the time zone set on your computer .
for your reference , the cloud flow designer appends the gmt offset to your date / time value .
for example , if your computer ’s time zone is set to pacific standard time and you create a variable midyear with a date / time value of 05/31/2014 11:59 pm , the cloud flow designer appends gmt -8:00 when displaying that value on your computer .
when a flow that displays midyear is run by a user whose time zone is set to pacific standard time in salesforce , 05/31/2014 11:59 pm appears .

providers ” you can add a provauthorizeendpointhost parameter to a salesforce authentication provider url to direct users to an authorization endpoint for a provided domain , such as
a custom domain created using my domain .
providing an authorization endpoint lets you take advantage of features like session discovery during authorization .
this parameter is only available for salesforce authentication providers , and can not be used to send users to an authorization page outside of a salesforce domain .
to direct your users to a specific salesforce authorization endpoint , you need to specify a url with the provauthorizeendpointhost request parameter and a valid https host .
query strings appended to the host url are ignored .
however , you can specify a community path .
if an authorization endpoint is not provided , salesforce uses the default authorization endpoint for the authorization provider .
if no default is set for the authorization provider , salesforce uses the endpoint for login.salesforce.com .
the authorization endpoint does not change the token endpoint , which continues to be the configured or default host .
for example ,  if the authorization endpoint is a sandbox instance , and your provider is set to use a production token endpoint , the flow fails , because authorization was granted by the sandbox instance , only .
the following is an example of a provauthorizeendpointhost parameter added to the authentication provider url : • • orgid is your auth .

salesforce supports authentication from a microsoft access control service using only oauth .
single sign - on authentication from a microsoft authentication provider is not supported . 1 .
define a microsoft access control service authentication provider in your salesforce organization . 2 .
register your application with microsoft , making salesforce the application domain .
3 .

2 . click new .
3 .
select microsoft access control service for the provider type .
4 .
enter a name for the provider .
5 .
enter the url suffix .
this is used in the client configuration urls .
for example , if the url suffix of your provider is “ mymicrosoftacsprovider , ” your callback url is similar to : https://login.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/00dx00000000001/mymicrosoftacsprovider 6 .
enter a placeholder value for the consumer key field ( you ’ll edit this value after your application is registered with microsoft ) .
7 .
enter a placeholder value for the consumer secret field ( you ’ll edit this value after your application is registered with microsoft ) .
8 .
enter the base url from your provider for the authorize endpoint url .
for example , sharepoint online uses the following form : https://<sharepoint online host name>/_layouts/15/oauthauthorize.aspx 9 .
enter the token endpoint url in the following form .
https://accounts.accesscontrol.windows.net/<tenant>/tokens/oauth/2?resource=<sender
id>/<sharepoint online host name>@<tenant > 232 force.com customization sharing • •
< tenant > is the office 365 tenant name ending with .onmicrosoft.com or the corresponding tenant globally unique identifier ( guid ) .
< sender id > is the identifier for the sender of the token .

you can use it with the auth .
authtoken apex class .
several client configuration urls are generated after defining the authentication provider : • • •
test - only initialization url : administrators use this url to ensure the third - party provider is set up correctly .
the administrator opens this url in a browser , signs in to the third party , and is redirected back to salesforce with a map of attributes .
oauth - only initialization url : use this url to obtain oauth access tokens for a third party .
users must authenticate with salesforce for the third - party service to get a token ; this flow does not provide for future single sign - on functionality .
callback url : use the callback url for the endpoint that the authentication provider calls back to for configuration .
the authentication provider has to redirect to the callback url with information for each of the above client configuration urls .
the client configuration urls support additional request parameters that enable you to direct users to log into specific sites , obtain customized permissions from the third party , or go to a specific location after authenticating .

previously , user sharing was automatically enabled only for new organizations that were provisioned after winter ’14 .
with summer ’14 , user sharing is automatically enabled for all organizations .
watch a demo : who sees whom :
user sharing with user sharing , you can : • set the organization - wide defaults for user records to private or public read only .
the default is public read
only for internal users and private for external users .
• create user sharing rules that are based on group membership or other criteria .
• create manual shares for user records to open access to individual users or groups .
for example , you ’re a manufacturer who needs to include all dealers in your organization while preventing them from seeing or interacting with each other
. you can set the organization - wide defaults for the user object to private .
then , open access among groups of dealers who need to see and interact with each other in the organization with sharing rules or manual sharing .
additionally , you can assign the “
view all users ” permission to users who need to see everyone in the organization .
users with the “ manage users ” permission are automatically granted the “
view all users ” permission .
for more information , see “
user sharing overview ” in the salesforce help .
control manual sharing for user records enable or prevent users from sharing their own user records with other users across the organization .
available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions to enable or disable manual user record sharing : “ manage sharing ”
user permissions needed previously , the sharing button was available on all user detail pages for organizations with user sharing .
this button enables a user to grant others access to the user ’s own user record , a method that is known as manual sharing .
now you can enable or disable the sharing button for all users via the sharing settings page by following these steps . 1 .
from setup , click security controls > sharing settings .
2 . click edit in the organization - wide defaults area .
3 .
select the manual user record sharing checkbox to display the sharing button on user detail pages , which enables users to share their records with others .
or deselect the checkbox to hide the button , which prevents users from sharing their user records with others .
4 . click save .
with summer ’14 , organizations that are enabling user sharing get the sharing button hidden on all user detail pages by default . 234 force.com customization external organization - wide defaults auto - enabled for all organizations when the organization - wide default for users is set to public read
only , users get read access to all other user records , can see those users in search and list views , and can interact with those users on chatter and communities .
for example , a partner user wants to collaborate with the sales representative in communities .
if you have disabled the community user visibility checkbox in the sharing settings page , community users can only be seen by themselves and their superiors in the role hierarchy .
you can use manual sharing to grant the partner user read access to the sales representative by using the sharing button on the sales representative ’s user detail page .
this access enables both parties to interact and collaborate in communities .
external organization - wide defaults auto - enabled for all organizations external organization - wide defaults enable you to set a different default access level for external users .
available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions
previously , if your organization wanted public read only or public read / write access for internal users but private for external users , you would have to set the default access to private and create a sharing rule to share records with all internal users .
with separate organization - wide defaults , you can achieve similar behavior by setting the default internal access to public read only or public read / write and the default external access to private .
these settings also speed up performance for reports , list views , searches , and api queries .
external organization - wide defaults simplify your sharing rules configuration and improve recalculation performance .
furthermore , they reduce overhead of sharing checks for search and reports , and improves sharing maintenance around realignments .
the following objects support external organization - wide defaults .
• accounts and their associated contracts and assets • cases • contacts • opportunities • custom objects •
users external users include : • authenticated website users • chatter external users • community users • customer portal users • guest users • high - volume portal users • partner portal users • service cloud portal users 235 force.com customization asynchronous parallel recalculation of sharing rules ( generally available ) note :  chatter external users have access to the user object only .
to start using the external organization - wide defaults , from setup , click security controls > sharing settings .
click the enable external sharing model button to enable the feature .
then , click edit in the organization - wide defaults area to edit the defaults .
for example , you want employees to have read and write access to accounts , but keep them private for external users in portals and communities . 1 .
set the default internal access to public read only or public read / write . 2 .
set the default external access to private to prevent external users from accessing those records .
the default external access level must be more restrictive or equal to the default internal access level .
asynchronous parallel recalculation of sharing rules ( generally available ) speed up sharing recalculation when you ’re working with sharing rules .
available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions when you create , update , or delete sharing rules , the resulting recalculation is now processed asynchronously and in parallel . the recalculation is run in parallel and asynchronously in the background , which speeds up the process and provides better resilience to site operations such as patches and server restarts .
you ’ll receive an email notification upon completion .
before the recalculation is completed , you ca n’t run other sharing operations such as creating a sharing rule or updating the organization - wide defaults .
parallel sharing rule recalculation is also run in these cases .
• click the recalculate button for the sharing rules on the sharing settings page • recalculate your sharing rules on the defer sharing page 236 force.com customization globalization to view your recent sharing operations , from setup , click security controls > view setup audit trail .
the view setup audit trail page displays entries for when the recalculation is started and whether it ’s successful .
to monitor the progress of your parallel recalculations , from setup , click monitoring > background jobs or jobs > background jobs .
the background jobs page displays granular information on each sharing operation .
for example , when parallel recalculation is run when an account criteria - based sharing rule is updated , the job type column displays parallel
sharing rule recalculation and the job sub type column displays account —
criteria - based sharing rule .

240 force.com development packaged connected apps copied to sandboxes packaged connected apps copied to sandboxes sandbox copy and refresh now support connected apps installed using a package installation , such as connected apps installed from the appexchange .
available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and database.com editions to view a sandbox : “ view setup and configuration ”
to create , refresh , activate , and delete sandbox : “ modify all data ” user permissions needed packaged connected apps can be copied to a sandbox , automatically during the creation or refresh of a sandbox .
however , sandbox copy and refresh do not copy connected apps created within the production organization .
for connected apps created within the production organization , delete any connected apps in the sandbox after the copy or refresh finishes .
then , re - create them in the sandbox to match the configuration in the production organization .
the new connected app in the sandbox can not use the same connected app api name value ( this is the same value as the fullname field in the metadata api ) .
match production licenses to sandbox without a refresh you can match provisioned licenses in production to your sandbox organization without having to refresh your sandbox .
available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and database.com editions to match licenses to sandbox : “ modify all data ” user permissions needed the matching process updates the license counts in your sandbox so that they match production , adds licenses to your sandbox that are in production but not in sandbox , and deletes licenses from sandbox that are n’t in production .
to match licenses to a sandbox organization , log in to your sandbox organization , and then from setup , click company profile > company information > match production licenses .
you ’ll get an alert informing you that the matching process has started .
after all licenses have been matched in sandbox , a confirmation email is sent to you .
the confirmation email is always sent to the user who initiates the license copy .
matching production licenses requires that your sandbox and production are on the same salesforce release .
if your sandbox has already been upgraded to the next release — for example , during sandbox preview — but production hasn't been upgraded yet , you ca n't match production licenses in sandbox .
change sets and deployment tools administrators and developers now have new ways to use change sets and external tools for deployments .
available in enterprise , performance , unlimited , and database.com editions 241 force.com development change sets included in the deployment status page if you ’re using the force.com migration tool or force.com ide , also see the changes in the metadata types and fields .
the components available for a change set vary by edition .
the following components are now available for change sets .
entitlement types the following entitlement type sets are now included in change sets . •
entitlement process •
entitlement template •
milestone account access on territory account access permissions are now included in territories and deployed as part of territories in change sets .
previously , account access permissions were n’t deployed as part of territories in change sets .
as part of this change , a new field has been added to the territory metadata type .
see territory in the “ metadata types and fields ” release note .
change sets included in the deployment status page you can monitor the status of all deployments in one place .
force.com migration tool support for rollbackonerror the force.com migration tool now accepts the rollbackonerror parameter in build.xml for deployment targets and no longer ignores this value .
change sets included in the deployment status page you can monitor the status of all deployments in one place .
in spring ’14 , the user interface to monitor deployments ( the deployment status page ) was improved to include more information about deployments , including errors and test failures .
the deployment status page included only deployments that are started from the metadata api or tools such as the force.com ide or the force.com migration tool .
in this release , the deployment status page shows all deployments — change sets , metadata api , and tools - based deployments .
the deployment type is added to the in - progress deployment section and the details page to differentiate between change sets and api - based deployments .
for example , this image shows an in - progress change set deployment .
to access the deployment status page from setup , click deployment status or deploy > deployment status .
the deployment history of change sets is retained on the deployment status page for 30 days .
after a deployment finishes , it is moved to the failed or succeeded section depending on whether the deployment failed or succeeded .
you can check the deployment results , including errors and test failures , on the deployment detail page by clicking view details next to a deployment .
242 force.com development force.com migration tool support for rollbackonerror
alternatively , deployment history is available on the change set detail page .
in the deployment history section , click view details next to a deployment to get more information .
force.com migration tool support for rollbackonerror the force.com migration tool now accepts the rollbackonerror parameter in build.xml for deployment targets and no longer ignores this value .
previously , the rollbackonerror parameter in build.xml always defaulted to true for deployment targets .
with the new version of the force.com migration tool , you can specify whether a complete rollback of a deployment is performed if a failure occurs by setting this parameter to true or false .
this parameter must be set to true if you ’re deploying to a production organization .
if the rollbackonerror parameter is not specified , the default is true .

request a signed request on demand you can now request signed request information in your canvas app on demand .
if your canvas app is set to use signed request for authentication , you can request a signed request on demand by using the sdk .
your app can ask salesforce to resend the signed request that was used when your app was loaded or to send a new 249 force.com development signed request canvas apps can be user - approved signed request .
requesting a signed request is useful when you are refreshing an expired session or getting authentication information after your app has been redirected . you can request a signed request on demand by using the refreshsignedrequest ( ) or repost ( ) javascript methods in the sdk . refreshsignedrequest ( ) returns a new signed request via a callback , while repost ( ) asks the parent window to initiate a new post to your canvas app and reloads the app page with a refreshed signed request .
signed request canvas apps can be user - approved canvas apps that use signed request as their access method can now be user - approved .
previously , a canvas app could only be user - approved if you used oauth authentication .
this is the default authorization method for canvas apps .
the signed request authorization flow varies depending on whether the canvas app ’s permitted users field is set to " admin approved users are pre - authorized " or " all users may self - authorize . " you ’ll need to modify the web application that ’s exposed as a canvas app to handle a get or post call as shown in this table . permitted users value canvas app accessibility admin approved users
are pre - authorized all users may self - authorize the app is accessible to users as soon as the administrator installs it in the organization and configures which users can see it .
users do n’t need to approve or deny access .
the app is accessible to all users , but the user is prompted to approve or deny access to the app .
when the user needs to approve the canvas app never post or get behavior salesforce performs a post to the canvas app with all the authorization information contained in the body of the signed request , including the refresh token . •
•
the first time that the user opens the app if the access token is revoked by the administrator if the administrator sets a time limit on the token and that time limit is exceeded •
if the user has previously approved the app and the access hasn’t been revoked or expired , salesforce performs a post to the canvas app with a signed request payload .
if the user hasn’t approved the app , or if the access has been revoked or expired , salesforce performs a get to the canvas app url .
the canvas app must handle the get by accepting the call and looking for the url parameter _ sfdc_canvas_authvalue .
if the canvas app receives this parameter value , the canvas app should initiate the approve or deny oauth flow . _
sfdc_canvas_authvalue = user_approval_required after the oauth flow is initiated and the user approves the app , the canvas app should call the repost ( ) method with a parameter of true to retrieve the signed request .
250 force.com development saml single sign - on for canvas apps saml single sign - on for canvas apps whether you use signed request or oauth authorization , you can use saml - based single sign - on ( sso ) to provide your users with a seamless authentication flow .
you can leverage salesforce as an identity provider or as a service provider .
saml sso enables you to give your users automatic authentication into your canvas app via saml and authentication into salesforce via the signed request .
saml ( security assertion markup language ) is an xml - based standard for user authentication on the web which allows the exchange of authorization data between two domains .
with this feature you can create a canvas app that begins a standard saml authentication flow when opened by a user .
after this process completes , the user is authenticated into your web application .
for canvas apps that use signed request authentication , two methods that are included in the force.com canvas sdk enable your canvas app to call into salesforce to receive a new signed request directly or enable salesforce to repost the signed request to your web application endpoint .
this results in a complete end - to - end authentication flow .
the elements that support this feature include the following features : saml initiation method field this field lets you specify which provider initiates the sso flow to access your canvas app . identity provider initiated — salesforce makes the initial request to start the sso flow . •
service provider initiated —
the canvas app starts the sso flow after the app is invoked . •
for more information , see the topic “ creating a connected app ” in the salesforce help .
refreshsignedrequest method returns a new signed request via a callback .
after the saml sso process is completed , your app can call this method and receive a new signed request .
this method is intended for developers who need to retrieve the signed request by using a more client - side javascript approach .
( the force.com canvas sdk sends the signed request to your app . )
repost method requests the parent window to initiate a post to your canvas app and reloads the app page with a refreshed signed request .
after the saml sso process is completed , your app can call this method and a new signed request is sent to your app via a post .
this method is for developers who need to retrieve the signed request using a more server - side approach .
( salesforce posts the signed request to your server . )
custom app lifecycle
by providing a custom apex class , you can control the context information that ’s sent to your canvas app and add custom behavior when your app is rendered .
salesforce provides several apex interfaces and classes in the canvas namespace that provide additional control over the canvas app lifecycle .
you can use the canvas namespace and the canvaslifecyclehandler interface to : • control what sections of the canvasrequest context data get sent to your app .
you can , for example , require that salesforce never send the organization information in the canvasrequest data .
excluding sections of context data improve performance by reducing the amount of data that ’s sent in the request and remove the need to process the organization data in your app . •
retrieve application context data when the app is rendered and alter the behavior of your app accordingly .
you can obtain the application version and , depending on the version , change how the app runs .
• modify some of the context data , such as the canvas app url , custom parameters , or the list of object fields that are returned in the record data when the app is rendered . •
present a well - formed error message to the user in the salesforce ui if something goes wrong .
251 force.com development developer console salesforce also provides a test class in the canvas namespace that you can use to create test context data and verify the behavior of your lifecycle handler without having to run your app .

254 force.com development visualforce development
an example of using remote method overrides in remote objects this sample code illustrates how to create remote method overrides for remote objects operations .
the example presents a sorted list of contacts and a simple form to enter a new contact .
the new contact action overrides the built - in remote objects create ( ) operation .
the sample also illustrates blending remote objects with several web development libraries to present a mobile - friendly user interface .
api versioning for sforce.one functions the sforce.one javascript utility object is used for managing navigation on visualforce pages that are used in salesforce1 apps .
this object is now versioned .
changes that alter its behavior wo n’t break visualforce pages , and you can write code that depends on version - specific functionality using the new sforce.one.getversion ( ) function .
deferred creation of dynamic components a dynamic component can now wait for page actions to be completed before the method that creates the dynamic component runs .
you can now design dynamic components that change depending on the result of , for example , a page initialization action or a callout .
this enhancement gives you additional options for creating dynamic , adaptable user interfaces in visualforce .
improvements to remote objects ( developer preview ) visualforce remote objects has been improved with new features , including remote method overrides , an upsert ( ) operation , the orderby query condition for specifying sort order , and new query operators for where conditions .

overrides give you new flexibility in what you can build with remote objects by enabling you to add your own custom logic to the basic operations .
see overriding default remote objects operations on page 256 for complete details .
upsert ( ) operation the upsert ( ) operation is a convenience method that gives you a shortcut for saving new data by updating an object or creating an object if it does n’t exist .
orderby conditions orderby enables you to set a sort order for your results .
you can sort on up to three fields .
specify your orderby conditions as an array of javascript objects that contain name - value pairs .
the field to sort on is the name , and the sort description is the value .
the sort description enables you to sort ascending or descending and to sort null values first or last .
for example : orderby : [ { phone : " desc nulls last " } , { firstname : " asc " } ] where condition operators the following new operators are available for where conditions . • • •
ne : not equals lte : less than or equals gte : greater than or equals 255 force.com development visualforce development geolocation support remote objects now supports retrieving and accessing geolocation custom fields .
you can use either the compound or individual components form of a geolocation field , by using slightly different code .
compound geolocation fields the compound form of a geolocation field groups latitude and longitude values in a single field .
declare the field as usual for remote objects : < apex : remoteobjectmodel name="warehouse__c " jsshorthand="warehouse " fields="id , name " > < /apex : remoteobjectmodel > < apex : remoteobjectfield name="location__c " jsshorthand="location"/ > the returned field is a javascript object with two attributes , longitude and latitude .
with a warehouse record as declared in the previous paragraph , access the individual longitude and latitude values by using dot notation : var long = record.get("location").longitude ; var lat = record.get("location").latitude ; geolocation field components you can also treat the two values of a geolocation field as individual component fields . declare each field separately , using the special individual component field naming convention of adding “ _ _ longitude__s ” and “ _ _ latitude__s ” to the geolocation field name : < apex : remoteobjectmodel name="warehouse__c " jsshorthand="warehouse " fields="id , name " > < apex : remoteobjectfield name="location__longitude__s " jsshorthand="longitude"/ > < apex : remoteobjectfield name="location__latitude__s " jsshorthand="latitude"/ > <
/apex : remoteobjectmodel > the returned fields are strings .
with a warehouse record as declared in the previous paragraph , access the individual longitude and latitude values directly : var long = record.get("longitude " ) ; var lat = record.get("latitude " ) ; errors
when accessing inaccessible fields remote objects respects your organization ’s field level security settings .
keep this in mind when you create pages that use remote objects .
fields that are n’t accessible to the person viewing the page appear blank .
in the initial release of remote objects , actions that modify field data ( create ( ) and update ( ) ) would succeed , updating accessible fields but silently ignoring any inaccessible fields .
this behavior could lead to inconsistent data .
beginning in this release , actions that modify data fail with an error if they include inaccessible fields in the request .
overriding default remote objects operations override the default remote objects operations with your own apex code to extend or customize the behavior of remote objects .
behind the scenes of remote objects , the basic operations — create ( ) , retrieve ( ) , update ( ) , and del()—use a remote objects controller that ’s the equivalent of the standard controller for normal visualforce pages .
you can override remote objects operations to extend or replace the built - in behavior of this controller .
overrides of remote objects operations are written in apex and take effect by adding them to your page ’s remote objects definitions .
256 force.com development visualforce development note :  you ca n’t override the upsert ( ) operation .
it ’s just a convenience function , and behind the scenes it delegates to either create ( ) or update ( ) .
when you override either of those methods , the overridden method is automatically used by upsert ( ) as appropriate .
remote objects access definitions for method overrides to override a remote objects operation with a remote method , set the attribute for the operation to the method that replaces the default method .
for example , here ’s how to override the create ( ) operation for contacts with a remote method .
< apex : remoteobjectmodel name="contact " fields="firstname , lastname , phone " create="{!$remoteaction .
remoteobjectcontactoverride.create}"/ >
the attribute takes a visualforce expression that references the @remoteaction method to use as the override for the built - in create ( ) operation .
the expression takes the form of $ remoteaction .
overrideclassname.overridemethodname , where the $ remoteaction global handles your organization namespace , as it does for javascript remoting .
note that the class that contains the @remoteaction method needs to be set as the page ’s controller or as a controller extension for the page .
with this declaration , whenever your page ’s javascript code calls the create ( ) function for a contact remote object , instead of using the remote objects controller , your remote method will be called .
remote objects override methods remote objects override methods are written as @remoteaction methods in an apex class , which you add to your page as a controller or controller extension .
the method signature for an override method is : @remoteaction public static map < string , object > methodname(string type , map < string , object > fields )
the type parameter is the sobject type that ’s being acted upon , and the fields map is a collection that contains the values that were set on the remote object before the overridden method was called .
the return value is a map that represents the result of a remote objects operation .
this map typically include the results of the call , the status , and any custom data that you want to provide as part of your custom method .
the simplest way to construct a valid return map is to use the remoteobjectcontroller .
this is the standard controller that provides the built - in functionality for remote objects , and you can delegate data manipulation language ( dml ) operations to it by passing along your method ’s parameters .
for example , here ’s a create ( ) method that does nothing more than the built - in version of create ( ) does : @remoteaction public static map < string , object > create(string type , map < string , object > fields ) { map < string , object > result = remoteobjectcontroller.create(type , fields ) ; return result ; } this method is effectively a no - op ; that is , this method does exactly the same thing the built - in version would have done , nothing more and nothing less .
your override methods can execute whatever additional apex you need to , including logging , additional dml , other method calls , and so on .
for a more complete example of a remote objects override method , and the page that uses it , see an example of using remote method overrides in remote objects on page 258 .
important :  the remoteobjectcontroller standard controller automatically handles sharing rules , ownership , and other security concerns for remote objects .
in contrast , methods in a custom controller or controller extension operate in system mode by default , which allows full access to all data in the organization .
this behavior is the same 257 force.com development visualforce development as for standard visualforce pages that use custom controllers or controller extensions .
when you write the controller code , you need to handle access rights and other concerns yourself .
as a best practice , use the with sharing keyword for your controller or controller extension class , and delegate as much as you can to the remoteobjectcontroller .
an example of using remote method overrides in remote objects this sample code illustrates how to create remote method overrides for remote objects operations .
the example presents a sorted list of contacts and a simple form to enter a new contact .
the new contact action overrides the built - in remote objects create ( ) operation .
the sample also illustrates blending remote objects with several web development libraries to present a mobile - friendly user interface .
this example uses the jquery , bootstrap , and mustache tool kits , loading them from an external content distribution network ( cdn ) .
here ’s the visualforce page , with the remote override declaration in bold .

bind application functions to ui events $ ( ' # brefresh').click(fetchcontacts ) ; $ ( ' # badd').click(addcontact ) ; //
initial load of the contacts list fetchcontacts ( ) ; < /script
> <
/apex : page > the key line of code in the preceding sample is in the remote objects access definition .
adding a single attribute to the contact remote object definition sets up the override : create="{!$remoteaction . remoteobjectcontactoverride.create } " the attribute takes a visualforce expression that references the @remoteaction method to use as the override for the built - in create ( ) operation .
260 force.com development visualforce development in this case , the referenced method is in an apex class that ’s the page ’s controller .
the code for the override method is straightforward .
public class with sharing remoteobjectcontactoverride { @remoteaction public static map < string , object > create(string type , map < string , object > fields ) { system.debug(logginglevel . info , ' before calling create on : ' + type ) ; // invoke the standard create action //
for when you want mostly - normal behavior , with a little something different map < string , object > result = remoteobjectcontroller.create(type , fields ) ; system.debug(logginglevel . info , ' after calling create on : ' + type ) ; system.debug(logginglevel . info , ' result : ' + result ) ; //
here 's the little something different , adding extra data to the result map
< string , object > customresult = customresult.putall(result ) ; return customresult ; new map < string , object > { ' custom ' = > ' my custom data ' } ; } } this method logs the @remoteaction call and then uses the standard remoteobjectcontroller.create ( ) call to perform the create .
it ’s performing the same data manipulation language ( dml ) commands to create the record that the built - in version would , because it ’s using the built - in version .
after performing the create , the method does a little more logging .
finally it adds some extra data to the return payload that will be received by the javascript callback function on the visualforce page .
it ’s adding the extra data that ’s interesting and makes overriding the built - in method useful .
the extra data that ’s added by the preceding controller is trivial , for the purposes of illustration only .
a real - world override can include more complex logic — the result of a calculation , other method calls , and so on .
what ’s important to understand is that the new custom override method can do additional things behind the scenes , and can return extra data that the built - in version ca n’t .
api versioning for sforce.one functions the sforce.one javascript utility object is used for managing navigation on visualforce pages that are used in salesforce1 apps .
this object is now versioned .
changes that alter its behavior wo n’t break visualforce pages , and you can write code that depends on version - specific functionality using the new sforce.one.getversion ( ) function .
how sforce.one handles api versions the sforce.one object is frequently improved in new releases of the salesforce1 platform .
to maintain backward compatibility , sforce.one provides version - specific behavior , and you can use a specific version of sforce.one in your apps .
by default , sforce.one uses the same version as the api version of the requested visualforce page .
for example , if a visualforce page has an api version of 30.0 , javascript on that page that uses sforce.one by default uses the api version 30.0 of sforce.one .
this means that when a visualforce page is updated to a new api version , the page automatically uses the updated version of sforce.one .
in the preceding example , if that visualforce page is updated to api version 31.0 , app functionality that uses sforce.one uses the api version 31.0 of sforce.one .
if updated behavior in a new api version of sforce.one causes compatibility problems with the page ’s features , you have three options for correcting the problem .
• revert the visualforce page ’s api version to the prior version .
this action requires no code changes .
261 force.com development visualforce development • update the code for the page ’s features to fix the problem .
this solution is best , but it might require some debugging , and it will definitely require code changes . •
use a specific version of sforce.one .
this solution often requires minimal code changes .
note : sforce.one was added in winter ’14 ( api version 29.0 ) and was n’t versioned until summer ’14 ( api version 31.0 ) .
all versions of sforce.one earlier than version 31.0 are identical to version 31.0 .
you can specify a version of sforce.one for any version that ’s valid for visualforce , that is , from version 15.0 to the current api version .
using a specific version of sforce.one to use a specific version of sforce.one , use the sforce.one.getversion ( ) function and provide it with the api version and a callback function that needs to use a specific version of sforce.one .
the appropriate versions of sforce.one are automatically loaded by this call .
the signature for sforce.one.getversion ( ) is : sforce.one.getversion(versionstring , callbackfunction ) ; versionstring is the api version that your application requires .
it ’s always two digits , a period , and one digit , such as “ 30.0 ” .
calls with invalid version strings fail silently .
callbackfunction is a javascript function that uses a specific version of sforce.one .
sforce.one.getversion ( ) operates asynchronously , and your callback function is called when it finishes loading the requested version of sforce.one .
your callback function receives a single parameter , an sforce.one object for the specified api version .
use the object passed in instead of the global sforce.one to make calls to sforce.one that conform to the api version that your app requires .
examples of using a specific version of sforce.one the next examples all add a create account function to the following input button : < input type="button " value="create account " onclick="btncreateaccount ( ) " id="btncreateacct"/ > defaulting to the visualforce page ’s api version app code that should use the default version of sforce.one—the version that corresponds to the visualforce page ’s api version — doesn’t need to ask for a version .
using that version happens automatically , and the code is straightforward .
< script > function myapp ( ) { this.createaccount = function ( ) { } ; sforce.one.navigatetourl("/001/e " ) ; } var app = new myapp ( ) ; function btncreateaccount ( ) { } app.createaccount ( ) ; < /script
> app functionality is created in a myapp object , and then an event handling function calls the app function when that event , a button click , occurs .
separating application functionality from application event handling is a best practice , and it sets you up for using version - specific versions of sforce.one .
using a specific sforce.one api version ( simple ) 262 force.com development visualforce development to use a specific version of sforce.one , get and save a reference to a versioned instance of the object .
then use this object to make sforce.one calls .
the simplest way is to save it in the myapp object .
in the next sample , references to the versioned instance of sforce.one are in bold .
< script > function myapp(sfone ) { this.createaccount = function ( ) { sfone.navigatetourl("/001/e " ) ; } ; } var app30 = null ; function btncreateaccount ( ) { //
create our app object if not already defined if(!app30 ) { //
create app object with versioned sforce.one sforce.one.getversion("30.0 " , function(sfonev30 ) { app30 = new myapp(sfonev30 ) ; app30.createaccount ( ) ; } ) ; return ; } app30.createaccount ( ) ; } < /script
>
in the preceding example , the event - handling function is expanded from the first example to include the creation of a version - specific instance of sforce.one .
if your app needs to mix multiple versions , you can create multiple myapp instances with appropriate versions and names .
more than one or two , though , are cumbersome to manage .
we recommend the next approach instead .
using a specific sforce.one api version ( best ) a better way to organize your app code is to create version - specific instances of sforce.one in an app initialization block of code so you can keep the event handling separate .
< script > function myapp(sfone ) { this.createaccount = function ( ) { sfone.navigatetourl("/001/e " ) ; } ; } var app30 = null ; //
initialize app : get versioned api , wire up clicks sforce.one.getversion("30.0 " , function(sfonev30 ) { //
create app object with versioned sforce.one app30 = new myapp(sfonev30 ) ; //
wire up button event var btn = document.getelementbyid("btncreateacct " ) ; btn.onclick = btncreateaccount ; } ) ; //
events handling functions // ca n't be fired until app is defined function btncreateaccount ( ) { } app30.createaccount ( ) ; < /script
> 263 force.com development visualforce development in this sample the app initialization is separated only by white space and comments , but you can separate it into functions for better encapsulation .
using a specific sforce.one api version ( synchronous ) you can trigger a synchronous mode for sforce.one by manually including the specific version of sforce.one’s javascript on your page .
the format for the url to the library is:/sforce / one / sforceoneversion / api.js .
here ’s an example : < script src=" / sforce / one/30.0/api.js"></script > < script > function myapp(sfone ) { this.createaccount = function ( ) { sfone.navigatetourl("/001/e " ) ; } ; app = new myapp(sfonev30 ) ; } var app = null ; sforce.one.getversion("30.0 " , function(sfonev30 ) { } ) ; //
events handling function // ca n't be fired until app is defined function btncreateaccount ( ) { } app.createaccount ( ) ; < /script
> although some situations require synchronous mode , the asynchronous version is preferred .
if you forget to manually include the correct versions of the sforce.one library , your code will contain bugs that are difficult to diagnose .
deferred creation of dynamic components a dynamic component can now wait for page actions to be completed before the method that creates the dynamic component runs .
you can now design dynamic components that change depending on the result of , for example , a page initialization action or a callout .
this enhancement gives you additional options for creating dynamic , adaptable user interfaces in visualforce .
dynamic visualforce components enable you to create user interfaces that adapt to a variety of conditions , adapting to differences in user settings or permissions , organization settings , custom settings , and so on .
dynamic components achieve this flexibility by being defined in apex rather than in markup .
prior to this release , the apex method that defines a dynamic component was always executed at page load time , before any action method that ’s defined for the page was run .
this meant that the component could n’t depend on a page ’s initialization or setup , callouts , or other long - running actions .
you can set the new invokeafteraction attribute of a dynamic component to true , and the component is created after any action that ’s defined for the < apex : page>. here ’s a simple page that has a single dynamic component , which is created after the page ’s action method , pageactionupdatemessage , is completed .
< apex : page controller="deferreddynamiccomponentcontroller " action="{!pageactionupdatemessage } " showheader="false " > < apex : dynamiccomponent componentvalue="{!dynamiccomp } " invokeafteraction="true"/ > < /apex : page > 264 force.com development visualforce development here ’s the associated controller that provides the dynamic component definition , and illustrates the effect of the invokeafteraction attribute .
public class deferreddynamiccomponentcontroller { private string msgtext { get ; set ; } public deferreddynamiccomponentcontroller ( ) { } public component .
apex . outputpanel getdynamiccomp ( ) {
this.msgtext = ' the controller is constructed . ' ; //
this is the component to return component .
apex
. outputpanel dynoutpanel= new component .
apex .
outputpanel ( ) ; dynoutpanel.layout = ' block ' ; //
child component to hold the message text component .
apex .
outputtext msgoutput = new component .
apex .
outputtext ( ) ; msgoutput.value = this.msgtext ; dynoutpanel.childcomponents.add(msgoutput ) ; return dynoutpanel ; } public object pageactionupdatemessage ( ) { this.msgtext= ' the page action method has been run . ' ; return null ; } } with the previous behavior for dynamic components , the msgtext value that ’s set in the constructor is displayed by the dynamic component .
setting invokeafteraction="true " on the dynamic component changes that behavior .
the page waits for the pageactionupdatemethod to be completed and then creates the dynamic component , and so the component displays the value for msgtext that ’s set in the pageactionupdatemessage action method instead .
this change is versioned , and you must update your pages to api version 31.0 or later to use the invokeafteraction attribute .
deferred creation of dynamic components and other actions invokeafteraction="true " affects dynamic components immediately at page load time , because that ’s when page actions run .
setting invokeafteraction="true " reverses the order of component creation and any action method on the page .
that is , the order of execution is changed for action methods on all the following components . • • • • • • •
when invokeafteraction="false " is set on a dynamic component , the order of execution is as follows .
this is the default behavior for dynamic components .
< apex : actionfunction > < apex : actionpoller > < apex : actionsupport > < apex : commandbutton > < apex : commandlink > < apex : page > < apex : togglepanel > 1 .
invoke the dynamic component ’s creation method , which constructs the component . 2 .
invoke the action method . 3 .
rerender the page .
when invokeafteraction="true " is set on a dynamic component , the order of execution is as follows . 265 force.com development
other changes in visualforce 1 .
invoke the action method . 2 .
invoke the dynamic component ’s creation method , which constructs the component . 3 .
rerender the page .
note :  in the second case , if the action method returns a pagereference , visualforce will redirect the request to the new page , and the dynamic component ’s creation method wo n’t be run .
to avoid a possible order - of - execution bug , it ’s a best practice that methods that create dynamic components do n’t have side effects .
other changes in visualforce we ’ve made some additional changes in visualforce .
renderstyle attribute added to topics : widget the topics widget lets users see , add , and remove topics on a record so it ’s easy to tag and categorize records .
use the renderstyle attribute to specify whether the widget appears with a basic or an advanced user interface .
< apex : lineseries > markerfill and fillcolor attributes default to strokecolor the markerfill and fillcolor attributes of the < apex : lineseries > charting component were n’t defaulting to match the component ’s strokecolor as documented .
this behavior has been corrected for pages that are set to api versions 31.0 and later .
consolidated inclusion of salesforce css and javascript resources the way that visualforce adds salesforce css and javascript resources to generated pages has been optimized .
the result is pages that are faster to download and more efficient to render in the browser than in prior releases .
enhanced session id management for visualforce visualforce session management has been improved to more correctly handle transitions between different salesforce.com servers .
the critical update is transparent in normal use but fixes problems with certain edge cases .

other changes in visualforce the renderstyle attribute is available in api version 31.0 and later .
< apex : lineseries > markerfill and fillcolor attributes default to strokecolor the markerfill and fillcolor attributes of the < apex : lineseries > charting component were n’t defaulting to match the component ’s strokecolor as documented .
this behavior has been corrected for pages that are set to api versions 31.0 and later .
visualforce < apex : lineseries > charts are designed so that , by default , the lines , markers , and fill color all match .
this worked as documented if the line colors were chosen automatically by visualforce , but if you set any of the line colors manually by using the strokecolor attribute , the corresponding markerfill and fillcolor did n’t change to match .
the work - around was to manually specify the markerfill and fillcolor , which adds extra markup .
( the alternative —
a hideous , mixed - color line series — is too horrible to contemplate . )
this behavior has been fixed , and markerfill and fillcolor default to the strokecolor if specified .
you can still manually specify mixed colors by setting markerfill or fillcolor explicitly .
this change is versioned , and you must update your pages or components to api 31.0 or later to access the improved behavior .
consolidated inclusion of salesforce css and javascript resources the way that visualforce adds salesforce css and javascript resources to generated pages has been optimized .
the result is pages that are faster to download and more efficient to render in the browser than in prior releases .
this optimization affects the salesforce resources that are used to provide salesforce styling and application functionality .
this change does n’t apply to the css and javascript that you add to your visualforce pages by using < apex : stylesheet > , < apex : includescript > , or static html .
< apex : stylesheet > and < apex : includescript > automatically consolidate duplicate inclusions of resources .
note :  salesforce does n’t support direct use of or dependency on the resources that are optimized by this change .
so , in theory , there should be no visible effect on your pages .
in practice , sometimes customers make unsupported use of these resources .
if your pages depend on specific salesforce stylesheets or javascript files , we recommend that you test them thoroughly in a sandbox or developer edition organization and fix any problems that you discover .
enhanced session id management for visualforce visualforce session management has been improved to more correctly handle transitions between different salesforce.com servers .
the critical update is transparent in normal use but fixes problems with certain edge cases .
the update changes how and when session ids are generated and managed .
salesforce.com
servers handle the change automatically , but if you have a custom integration that relies on session id values , we recommend that you verify this update for compatibility in a sandbox or developer edition organization before enabling it permanently in your production organization .
if you activate this update now , the enhanced session id management will be used for all visualforce pages in your organization .
otherwise , this update will be enabled for your organization on the activation date .

describe limits removed limits for all apex describe calls have been removed for all api versions .
describe calls include describes for sobjects , fields , field sets , child relationships , picklists , and record types .
you ’re no longer limited to describing 100 objects or to executing 100 describe statements .
for example , describesobjects can now describe more than 100 sobjects .
schema .
describesobjectresult [ ] results = schema.describesobjects(new string[]{'account','contact ' , ... } ) ; 268 force.com development script statement limits methods removed
you ’re no longer bound by 100 fields or fieldsets statements in your code to describe fields and field sets respectively .
the following example shows fields and fieldsets statements . //
get the field describe result for the name field on the account object schema .
describefieldresult fieldresult = schema.sobjecttype
. account.fields .
name ; //
get information about a field set named fieldset1 schema .
fieldset fs1 = schema .
sobjecttype .
account.fieldsets.fieldset1 ;
the previous examples show only a subset of the describe method calls that are no longer bounded by the describe limit .
other method calls include getchildrelationships ( ) and getrecordtypeinfos ( ) of schema .
describesobjectresult , among others .
also , the associated limits methods for describe calls are now removed .
for earlier versions ( api version 30.0 and earlier ) , these methods still exist but are deprecated .
the affected methods are : getchildrelationshipsdescribes ( ) getfieldsdescribes ( ) getfieldsetsdescribes ( ) getpicklistdescribes ( ) getrecordtypesdescribes ( ) getlimitchildrelationshipsdescribes ( ) getlimitfieldsdescribes ( ) getlimitfieldsetsdescribes ( ) getlimitpicklistdescribes ( ) getlimitrecordtypesdescribes ( ) • • • • • • • • • • script statement limits methods removed the limits methods for script statements have been removed but are available and deprecated in api version 30.0 and earlier . because the script statement limit is no longer enforced in any api version since winter ’14 , the associated limits methods are no longer needed .
the affected methods in the limits class are : getscriptstatements ( ) getlimitscriptstatements ( ) • • create price book entries in apex tests you can create price book entries for standard and custom price books in apex tests .
previously , you could n’t create price book entries in an apex test by default unless the test had access to organization data via the @istest(seealldata = true ) annotation .
with this new support , you can isolate your price book test data from your organization data .
note that custom price books can be created but standard price books can not .
support for test price book entries is added for all tests , including tests that use the default data isolation mode ( tests that ca n’t access organization data ) .
with this support , you can do the following . •
query for the id of the standard price book in your organization with the test.getstandardpricebookid ( ) method .
• create test price book entries with standard prices by using the standard price book id that ’s returned by test.getstandardpricebookid ( ) .
269 force.com development submit more batch jobs with apex flex queue ( pilot ) • create test custom price books , which enables you to add price book entries with custom prices .
example this example creates some test data for price book entries .
the test method in this example gets the standard price book id and uses this id to create a price book entry for a product with a standard price .
next , the test creates a custom price book and uses the id of this custom price book to add a price book entry with a custom price .
@istest public class pricebooktest { // utility method that can be called by apex tests to create price book entries .
static testmethod void addpricebookentries ( ) { // first , set up test price book entries . //
insert a test product . product2
prod = new product2(name = ' laptop x200 ' , family = ' hardware ' ) ; insert prod ; //
get standard price book id . //
this is available irrespective of the state of seealldata .
i d pricebookid = test.getstandardpricebookid ( ) ; // 1 . insert a price book entry for the standard price book . //
standard price book entries require the standard price book id we got earlier .
pricebookentry standardprice = new pricebookentry ( pricebook2id = pricebookid , product2id = prod .
id , unitprice = 10000 , isactive = true ) ; insert standardprice ; //
create a custom price book pricebook2 custompb = new pricebook2(name='custom pricebook ' , isactive = true ) ; insert custompb ; // 2 .
insert a price book entry with a custom price .
pricebookentry customprice = new pricebookentry ( pricebook2id = custompb.id , product2id = prod .
id , unitprice = 12000 , isactive = true ) ; insert customprice ; //
next , perform some tests with your test price book entries . } } submit more batch jobs with apex flex queue ( pilot ) you can submit more batch jobs simultaneously and actively manage the order of the queued jobs .
note :  this feature is currently available through a pilot program .
for information about enabling apex flex queue for your organization , contact salesforce.com .
the apex flex queue pilot enables you to submit batch jobs beyond the allowed limit of five queued or active jobs .
any jobs that are submitted for execution but are n’t processed immediately by the system are in holding status and are placed in a separate queue ( the apex flex queue ) .
up to 100 batch jobs can be in the holding status .
when system resources become available , the system picks up jobs from the apex flex queue and moves them to the batch job queue .
the status of these moved jobs changes from holding to queued .
queued jobs get executed when the system is ready to process new jobs .
without administrator intervention , jobs are processed first - in first - out — in the order in which they ’re submitted .
administrators can modify the order of jobs that are held in the apex flex queue to control when they get processed by the system .
for example , you can move a batch job up to the first position in the holding queue so that it is the first job that gets processed when the system fetches the next held job from the flex queue
. 270 force.com development run future methods with higher limits ( pilot ) monitoring and reordering the apex flex queue you can monitor and reorder batch jobs that are held in the flex queue in the salesforce user interface .
to do so , from setup , click jobs > apex flex queue .
this page lists all batch jobs that are in holding status with some information about the job , such as the job id , the submission date , and the apex class .
by default , these jobs are numbered in the order they were submitted , starting with position 1 , which corresponds to the job that was submitted first .
you can change the position of a job by clicking reorder next to a job and then entering the position number of the job above which you want to move your job .
the system places the job immediately before the specified position with the following exceptions : specifying a position of 1 or lower moves the job to the beginning of the queue , and specifying a position greater than the number of jobs in the queue moves the job to the end of the queue .
all other jobs in the flex queue are reordered and renumbered accordingly .
when the system selects the next job from the apex flex queue for processing , this job is removed from the apex flex queue and moved to the batch job queue .
you can monitor the moved job in the apex jobs page by clicking apex jobs . submitting jobs by calling database.executebatch to submit a batch job , call database.executebatch .
the resulting outcome of database.executebatch depends on whether your organization has reached the five queued or active batch job limit . • • •
if system resources are available for processing jobs , the batch job is queued for execution and its status is queued .
if no system resources are available , the batch job is placed in the apex flex queue and its status is holding .
if the apex flex queue has the maximum number ( 100 ) of jobs , this method returns an error and does n’t place the job in the queue .
asyncapexjob status field the asyncapexjob object , which represents a batch job , has a new status field value of holding .
this new status indicates that the job is placed in the apex flex queue and is waiting to be picked up when system resources are available .
the following table lists all possible statuses for a batch job and a description of each .
status holding queued preparing processing aborted completed failed description job has been submitted and is held until system resources are freed up .
job is awaiting execution .
the start method of the job has been invoked .
this status might last a few minutes depending on the size of the batch of records .
job is being processed .
job was aborted by a user .
job completed with or without failures .
job experienced a system failure run future methods with higher limits ( pilot ) avoid reaching governor limits in your asynchronous future method by running your method with double or triple capacity for a resource .
note :  this feature is currently available through a pilot program .
for information about enabling enhanced future methods for your organization , contact salesforce.com .
271 force.com development run future methods with higher limits ( pilot ) apex future methods ( methods that are annotated with @future ) currently have the higher asynchronous limits for heap size , cpu timeout , and number of soql queries .
this pilot enables you to specify even higher values for these and for additional limits in future methods .
if you were exceeding a governor limit in your future method , or if you think a future method requires a higher limit , you can increase this limit for your future method .
note :  running future methods with higher limits might slow down the execution of all your future methods .
one of the following limits can be doubled or tripled for each future method . •
heap size • cpu timeout • number of soql queries • number of dml statements issued • number of records that were processed as a result of dml operations , aprroval.process , or database.emptyrecyclebin the higher limit is specified in the method definition as part of the @future annotation by using the limit parameter , in the following syntax : @future(limits='2x|3xlimitname ' )
for example , to double the amount of heap size that is allowed in your future method , define your method as follows : @future(limits='2xheap ' ) public static void myfuturemethod ( ) { } //
your code here tip :  keep in mind that you can specify only one higher limit per future method .
decide which of the modifiable limits you need the most for your method .
the following limit modifiers are supported .
the string value passed to the limits parameter inside the annotation is case - insensitive .
modifier @future(limits='2xheap ' ) @future(limits='3xheap ' ) @future(limits='2xcpu ' ) @future(limits='3xcpu ' ) @future(limits='2xsoql ' ) @future(limits='3xsoql ' ) @future(limits='2xdml ' ) @future(limits='3xdml ' ) @future(limits='2xdmlrows')1 description heap size limit is doubled ( 24 mb ) .
heap size limit is tripled ( 36 mb ) .
cpu timeout is doubled ( 120,000 milliseconds ) .
cpu timeout is tripled ( 180,000 milliseconds ) .
number of soql queries limit is doubled ( 400 ) .
number of soql queries limit is tripled ( 600 ) .
number of dml statements limit is doubled ( 300 ) .
number of dml statements limit is tripled ( 450 ) .
number of records that were processed as a result of dml operations is doubled ( 20,000 ) .

many chatter rest api resource actions are exposed as static methods on apex classes in the connectapi namespace .
these methods use other connectapi classes to input and return information .
the connectapi namespace is referred to as chatter in apex .
in apex , it ’s possible to access some chatter data using soql queries and objects .
however , connectapi classes expose chatter data in a much simpler way .
data is localized and structured for display .
for example , instead of making many calls to access and assemble a feed , you can do it with a single call .
note :  to integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third party web applications with chatter , use chatter rest api .
general updates to chatter in apex new and changed chatter in apex classes new and changed chatter in apex input classes new and changed chatter in apex output classes new and changed chatter in apex enums general updates to chatter in apex documentation indicates whether a method requires chatter each connectapi method in the apex developer ’s guide has a section indicating whether or not the method requires that the user calling the method has access to chatter .
to verify that the user has access , check the haschatter property of the connectapi .
userdetails or the connectapi .

new and changed chatter in apex classes feed elements in api versions 30.0 and earlier , a feed contains feed items .
as of api version 31.0 , a feed contains feed elements .
the connectapi .
feedelement class is abstract .
in api version 31.0 , its concrete subclasses are connectapi .
feeditem and connectapi .
bundle .
a bundle ( or bundled post ) contains feed elements and keeps the feed clean and organized .
in summer ‘ 14 , bundled posts are collections of feed tracked change feed items in record feeds only and are supported in the salesforce1 mobile browser app only .
bundled posts are available through a pilot program .
for information on enabling bundled posts for your organization , contact salesforce.com .
the feed element in this image is a bundle of feed tracked changes for the acme inc. account : 277 force.com development chatter in apex ( connectapi ) 1 .
the header indicating that this bundle contains feed tracked changes for a record . 2 .
the auxiliary body indicating the changed field and the new and old values .

feedtype .
record for the feedtype parameter .
in api versions 30.0 and earlier , every feed item supported comments , likes , topics , and so on .
in versions 31.0 and later , every feed item ( and feed element ) can have a unique set of capabilities .
if a capability property exists on a feed element , that capability is available , even if the capability property does n’t have a value .
for example , if the chatterlikes capability property exists on a feed element ( with or without a value ) , the logged - in user can like that feed element .
if the capability property does n’t exist , it is n’t possible to like that feed element .
a capability can also contain associated data .
for example , the moderation capability contains data about moderation flags .
methods that get feed elements return connectapi .
feedelementpage objects , which contain a list of connectapi .
feedelement objects .
the connectapi .
feedelement.capabilities property contains a connectapi .
feedelementcapabilities object that contains all the capabilities of a particular feed element .
tip :  the getfeeditem and postfeeditem methods are still supported , but to future - proof your applications , use the getfeedelement and postfeedelement methods .
for example , as of api version 31.0 , the only feed element types are feed item and bundle , but that could change in future releases .

resource - specific request parameters are ignored when a request includes a request body when you make a request that includes resource - specific request parameters and a request body , the resource - specific request parameters are ignored .
for example , the originalfeedelementid parameter in this request is ignored and the request body is processed : post /chatter / feed - elements?originalfeedelementid=0d5d0000000xzlc { " body " : { { " messagesegments " : [ " type " : " text " , " text " : " when should we meet for release planning ?

for example , you can define whether an action link group can be executed once , once per user , or an unlimited number of times per user .
to create an action link group definition , make a post request to the new /connect / action - link - group - definitions resource .
pass the new action link group definition input request body which includes action link definition input request bodies defining each action link .
post a feed item that is associated with one or more action link groups to post a feed item that is associated with one or more action link groups , make a post request to the new /chatter / feed - elements resource .

use the upsertmetadata ( ) call to create or update any component that extends metadata .
all components must be of the same type in the same call .
for more details , see metadata components and types .
if the specified components already exist in your organization , the upsertmetadata ( ) call updates them .
otherwise , upsertmetadata ( ) creates these components .
components are matched by the fullname field .
this call executes synchronously , which means that the call returns only after the operation is completed .
updated metadata calls the following metadata api calls changed .
modified process for retrieve ( )
in api version 31.0 and later , the process of making a retrieve ( ) call has been simplified .
you no longer have to call checkstatus ( ) after a retrieve ( ) call to obtain the status of the retrieve operation .
instead , make calls to checkretrievestatus ( ) only .
if the retrieve operation is in progress , call checkretrievestatus ( ) again until the retrieve operation is completed .
the checkstatus ( ) call is still supported in versions api version 30.0 or earlier , but is not available in api version 31.0 and later .

by analyzing this information , you can gain valuable insights into the utilization and performance of your app across your entire customer base .
available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions tracking changes in your app ’s usage over time can help you identify : •
the features most and least used — this can help you prioritize your development efforts when planning the next version of your app . •
the customers using your app most intensively — these are your most valuable customers . •
the customers whose usage of your app is minimal or declining — these are the customers most at risk of attrition
. you can collect the following daily metrics on two types of components in a managed package . •
custom objects — the total number of records existing per organization in each custom object .
this enables you to track how the usage of that custom object is growing with time in any subscriber organization , which is a reliable indicator of how much it 's being utilized • visualforce pages — the number of times per organization each visualforce page was accessed , the number of unique users who accessed it , and the average loading time ( in milliseconds ) .
by comparing the metrics for different visualforce pages , you can determine the relative popularity of different parts of your app in a specific customer organization , as well as trends across all customers .
the custom objects data is a snapshot that reflects the state of the organization at the time the database was sampled , while the visualforce data covers usage over a 24-hour period .
the usage metrics data for all production organizations in a given instance is merged and written into a text file , in a specified format , once a day .
currently , no data is collected on packages installed in sandbox organizations or on managed beta packages .
this feature is intended for api access only .
the usage data for a package is stored in metricsdatafile records in your reporting organization .
you must write a custom process to collect the metrics data from the reporting organization , and export it to a system of your choice for analysis .
this gives you the maximum flexibility to monitor and analyze the usage trends most relevant for your app .
your customers’ consent is not required for usage data to be collected , and there ’s no way for them to opt out .
this ensures you receive complete data for your entire customer base .
allowing some users to be excluded would skew the results , making the data less useful .
336 force.com development usage metrics ( generally available ) note :  if any of your customers have concerns about privacy , reassure them any data collected is limited to usage statistics .
no customer data is ever exposed to the isv under any circumstances .

setting up usage metrics accessing usage metrics data setting up usage metrics to set up usage metrics for any package , two organizations have special importance .
• release organization — the development edition organization used to upload the package .
• reporting organization — the organization to which the usage data is delivered , on a daily basis .
the release organization and reporting organization must be members of the same environment hub .
this is a security feature , to ensure usage data is only delivered to an organization controlled by the developer of the package .
we recommend using the environment hub as your reporting organization .
note :  for information on setting up and connecting organizations to the environment hub , see environment hub in the online help .
to set up usage metrics for a package : 1 .
set up environment hub , if you haven’t already done so . 2 .
connect the release organization to the environment hub .
3 .
connect the reporting organization to the environment hub ( if they ’re different ) .
4 . log a case in the partner community to activate usage metrics .
you ’ll need to provide the package id for your app .
once the feature is activated , you ’ll receive a confirmation email .
from that point on , usage data will automatically be collected from all organizations in which your package is installed , and delivered to the reporting organization on a daily basis .
there is no way to get usage data retroactively , that is , for any period prior to the activation of usage metrics . accessing usage metrics data

when creating a mobile connected app , you can specify a set of mobile packaging attributes , such as the platform , version , form factor , and mobile app binary file .
if you then include the mobile connected app as a component when creating a package , these attributes are included in the package and migrated when a user moves a package from one organization to another .
in addition , after you create and package a mobile connected app , it ’s instantly available for distribution via a listing in the private appexchange .
here are the steps for creating a mobile connected app . 1 .
from setup , click create > apps . 2 .
in the connected apps section , click new .
3 .
enter the relevant information in the basic information , api ( enable oauth ) , and web app settings sections .
4 .
enter the following information in the mobile app settings section .
a. select pin protect , if your app supports pin protection .
this gives an administrator the option of setting the session timeout and pin length for mobile applications after installing the connected app .
pin protection is automatically supported by the salesforce mobile sdk ( https://developer.salesforce.com/page/mobile_sdk ) .
you can also implement it manually by reading the mobile_policy object from the user ’s identity url .
b. specify the app platform by choosing ios or android from the drop - down list .
c. specify the supported device form factor(s ) for the mobile app from the restrict to device type drop - down list .
the possible values are phone , tablet , or mini - tablet .
if the app is universal ( that is , supports all form factors ) , do n’t choose any value .
d. enter the app version number of the mobile app .
e. enter the minimum os version required for the app .
f. select private app to confirm this app is for internal ( non - public ) distribution only .
this is required because apple does n’t allow distribution of public mobile apps outside of its app store .

click save .
you can now publish your app , make further edits , or delete it .
note :  if you remove mobile integration from a new version of an existing connected app , mobile integration is no longer included in any version of the connected app .
for example , imagine publishing a package containing version 1.0 of your connected app with mobile integration .
then remove mobile integration from the app , repackage it , and publish it as version 1.1 .
if a customer installs the earlier package with version 1.0 at this point , the version 1.0 connected app will not contain mobile integration .
your connected app can receive push notifications if : • your app is built with salesforce mobile sdk . •
your app implements the mobile sdk push notification protocol for your platform . •
you are a registered developer with the mobile platform provider ( apple or google ) . •
your app is registered with apple push notification service ( apns ) for ios push notifications or with google cloud messaging ( gcm ) for android push notifications . •
you ’ve implemented apex handlers for push notifications .
note :  a push - enabled connected app can support only one mobile platform .
if you provide android and ios versions of your mobile app and need to support push notifications on both versions , create a connected app for each platform .
to learn how to fulfill these requirements , see the salesforce mobile push notifications implementation guide .
