editions
when users are first enabled for lightning experience , the new interface is their default , preferred experience .
ideally , your lightning experience users find that the new interface meets all their needs .
but if there ’s an important feature or tool back in the classic interface , they can switch to salesforce classic at any time , without assistance from you .
to head back to salesforce classic , use the switcher .
in the lightning experience header , click the profile picture and select switch to salesforce classic .
available in : group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions
the switcher changes the default preference to salesforce classic .
the user remains in the classic interface until using the switcher to return to lightning experience .
and then the new interface becomes the default preference .
you get the idea .
to find the switcher in salesforce classic , click the name in the upper - right corner , then select switch to lightning experience .
53 salesforce spring ’16 release notes is lightning experience right for your salesforce org ?
the fact that your users have the power to move themselves between interfaces probably affects your decision about when to start using lightning experience .
if lightning experience is missing only a few features that your team uses occasionally , asking users to switch between interfaces can be an acceptable trade - off given the benefits of the new experience .
but it ’s best to keep users who need daily access to unsupported sales features or who work regularly with service features in salesforce classic — at least for now .

what ’s the fate of existing salesforce customizations ?
we 've worked hard to respect your existing configurations and customizations in lightning experience .
many of your point - and - click and programmatic implementations also work seamlessly in the new interface .
however , some customizations do n’t apply in the new interface or require updating to take advantage of all that lightning experience has to offer .
here are some issues to consider .
lightning experience navigation menu lightning experience replaces the salesforce classic tab bar with a collapsible navigation menu along the left side of the page .
customizations made to the tab bar in the classic interface are n’t reflected in the navigation menu .
instead , you can create multiple custom navigation menus and assign them to user profiles .
which means you can empower different types of users , like sales reps , sales managers , and execs , with a navigation experience that ’s unique to their business needs .
you can add a wide variety of items to a custom navigation menu , including many standard salesforce objects , your custom objects , lightning component and visualforce tabs , and other items like home , the main feed , people , groups , files , dashboards , reports , and the user ’s task list and calendar .
in fact , most of the items that appear in the app launcher can go in a custom navigation menu .
the few exceptions include connected apps , lightning page tabs , and some salesforce objects that are n’t supported in lightning experience .
items that ca n’t go in a custom navigation menu are always available from the app launcher by clicking in the header .
to learn more , see customize lightning experience navigation menus  and navigation and actions : what ’s not in lightning experience in the salesforce help .
page layouts and compact layouts record page customizations made in salesforce classic — for custom and standard objects — also affect record pages in lightning experience .
however , some page elements display differently in lightning experience , and some are n’t supported .
compact layouts play the same role in lightning experience that they do for the salesforce1 mobile app : displaying a record ’s key fields in the highlights panel on a record page .
in lightning experience , the highlights panel shows the first five fields from your current compact layouts .
actions and buttons if you ’ve already created and used actions in salesforce classic , you know that they appear in the chatter publisher , while standard and custom buttons appear above the details on a record page .
and if you use salesforce1 , you know that all action types and buttons are co - mingled on the salesforce1 action bar .
in lightning experience , we continue to blur the line between actions and buttons .
but instead of displaying in a single place , actions and buttons are grouped by type in several different areas on the record page .
by default , lightning experience includes the actions and buttons defined in the salesforce1 and lightning experience actions section on the global publisher layout .
or you can customize what ’s available using the same section on object page layouts .
here ’s the logic that determines where on the record page an action or button appears .
• global actions with the log a call action type or the create a record action type for events , notes , and tasks display in the global actions menu in the header .
•
most quick actions , productivity actions , standard buttons , and supported custom buttons are added to the page - level action menu . • object - specific activities - related actions , such as log a call , new event , new task , and email , display in the composer on the activity tab . •
standard chatter actions appear in the composer on the collaborate tab .
the order of actions in each area is based on the order in which they ’ve been added to the global publisher or object page layout .
to learn more , see actions in lightning experience in the salesforce help . 61 salesforce spring ’16 release notes is lightning experience right for your salesforce org ?
custom buttons custom buttons that use a javascript content source are n’t supported in lightning experience .
you can replace some of the functions covered by these buttons by using point - and - click tools , like process builder , visual workflow , or code - driven approaches .
custom buttons that define the content source as a url or visualforce page work as you ’d expect .
visualforce and lightning components yes , lightning experience is a major change from salesforce classic , but that does n’t mean your visualforce pages stop working .
this release includes beta support for visualforce in lightning experience .
your existing visualforce pages work in lightning experience , many without needing any revisions .
because things have moved around in the new interface , you ’ll want to complete some chores to make sure your visualforce pages work the way you expect .
and at this point , a few visualforce features do n’t work in lightning experience .
here are a few basic details to consider . •
if your visualforce pages use javascript , there are things you need to check
. visualforce does n’t “ own ” the whole page when shown in lightning experience , and because of that , your javascript code needs to play by some new rules . •
if your visualforce pages use the built - in standard components , their look - and - feel matches salesforce classic , whether users access them in the new or old interface .
some work is needed if you want your pages to match the lightning experience styling .
to help with this effort , we ’re publishing the salesforce lightning design system ( slds ) , a collection of design patterns , components , and guidelines for creating interfaces that fit in with lightning experience .
the slds is available at www.lightningdesignsystem.com .
for the complete skinny on what works and does n’t work , see the “ visualforce & lightning experience ” module in the developer trail - lightning experience trailhead trail .
what about new ui customization ?
the lightning component framework is our new ui framework for developing dynamic web apps for both desktop and mobile devices .
you can use it or visualforce in your new projects .
to learn more about ui development , see “
user interface development considerations ” in the lightning experience development trailhead module .
to learn more about lightning components , see the “ lightning components ” module in the developer trail - lightning experience trailhead trail .
force.com
canvas force.com canvas allows you to easily integrate third - party applications in salesforce .
canvas functionality in lightning experience is the same as in salesforce classic .
you can still embed canvas apps in visualforce pages and everywhere else they ’re supported , with the added bonus that you can expose canvas apps in lightning components .
salesforce apis and apex most of the programmatic tools and processes you ’re used to are largely unaffected by lightning experience .
we ’ve kept our promise that our new releases wo n’t break your dependencies on salesforce apis .
tools like workbench haven’t changed .
your development environment is the same as ever .
while your apex classes and api calls work fine , some features are n’t yet supported in lightning experience .
if a user is in the new interface and executes some apex code that interacts with an unsupported feature , the user ca n’t complete the task .
to address this scenario , we ’ve added capabilities to determine a user ’s interface preference from both the api and apex .
you can use this functionality to add logic to your existing code so that your users do n’t encounter errors .
see “ understanding changes to other development tools ” in the lightning experience development trailhead module for full details .
appexchange apps many apps from the appexchange feature customizations , including custom objects , custom buttons , visualforce pages , and more .
salesforce partners are testing their apps in lightning experience and applying for lightning ready certification .
apps that are lightning 62 salesforce spring ’16 release notes transition to lightning experience : let ’s do this !
ready work in lightning experience and offer a more consistent experience with other lightning pages .
if an app is supported in lightning experience , a lightning ready sash appears on its appexchange listing .
if an app is n’t supported in lightning experience , use it in salesforce classic instead .
note :  your org can use apps without lightning ready certification in lightning experience , but some features might not be available or work as expected .
these apps can also appear visually inconsistent with lightning experience because they use salesforce classic styling .
for the best experience , use salesforce classic for apps that are n’t certified as lightning ready .

important :
okay , if you use group edition that ’s overstating things .
it ’s not possible to remove the “ lightning experience user ” permission from your org ’s standard profiles and custom profiles are n’t available .
so it ’s “ all or nothing ” if you want to turn on lightning experience — all your users switch immediately to the new interface .
be sure to prepare your users for their new salesforce experience and give them advance notice before you change to lightning experience .
and remember , users who prefer to remain in salesforce classic can always switch themselves back via the switcher .
first things first , do you have users with standard profiles who should n’t get lightning experience yet ?
move these users to custom profiles that do n’t include the “ lightning experience user ” permission .
editions profiles and permission sets available in : both salesforce classic and lightning experience profiles available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions permission sets available in : group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions for users with custom profiles , decide who gets lightning experience .
custom profiles do n’t automatically include the “
lightning experience user ” permission so it ’s up to you .
consider these options . •
want to test lightning experience with a small group of custom profile users but you do n’t want to turn it on for everyone assigned to these profiles ? create a permission set that includes the “ lightning experience user ” permission .
then apply the permission set to each pilot user .
when you turn on lightning experience , only pilot users see the new interface .
are you new to permission sets ?
check out this walkthrough !

or ready to enable all your custom profile users ?
adding the “ lightning experience user ” permission to profiles is the fastest way to mass - enable the new user interface .
if you ’re dealing with many profiles , you can tackle them at the same time with the data loader .
but remember , with great power comes great responsibility .
take care you do n’t inadvertently enable or disable other features .
if you ’re going to limit lightning experience to a subset of your users , we recommend that you keep all members of a functional team on the same experience .
if you have team members who often share links and work closely together , include them all in your pilot .

gotchas
if users switch between lightning experience and salesforce classic switching between lightning experience and salesforce classic is fast and easy .
but switching between interfaces affects the underlying url routing logic and can lead to some unexpected results when links are resolved .
this means there can be snags with bookmarks and sharing links in emails or chatter posts , especially if your organization has a subset of users authorized for lightning experience while others are still using salesforce classic .
editions available in : group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions
when users are first enabled for lightning experience , the new interface is their default , preferred experience .
every time a user switches interfaces via the switcher , the user ’s default preference resets to the current environment .
with this behavior in mind , here are the typical link routing interactions your users can encounter .
user has the “
lightning user ’s default experience where links open experience user ”
permission ?
yes lightning experience for pages supported in lightning experience , links open in the new interface ( even for links generated in salesforce classic ) .
links to unsupported pages are directed to salesforce classic , which opens in a new tab .
this temporary redirection does n’t change the user ’s default preference to salesforce classic .
the next time the user selects a link that is supported in the new interface , the salesforce classic tab is reloaded to open the link in lightning experience .
yes salesforce classic links generally open in salesforce classic .
if a link was generated in lightning experience ( meaning it includes /one
/ one.app  in the url ) , the link opens in lightning experience .
the user ’s default preference does n’t change to lightning experience . 85 salesforce spring ’16 release notes lightning experience considerations user has the “
lightning user ’s default experience where links open experience user ”
permission ?
no salesforce classic links open in salesforce classic only .
if a link was generated in lightning experience ( meaning it includes /one
/ one.app  in the url ) , the link does n’t open , because the user ca n’t access lightning experience .
given these routing behaviors , you can see the potential for confusion if users share lightning experience links with salesforce classic users .
to avoid this problem , we recommend enabling the new interface for all users who work closely together .
we also recommend training your lightning experience users to understand how links and bookmarks work across the two experiences .

saying hello to lightning experience does n’t mean saying goodbye to salesforce classic 86 salesforce spring ’16 release notes lightning
experience considerations data access and views : what ’s not in lightning experience list views here are some considerations when creating and editing list views in lightning experience . •
you do n’t go to a new page to create a list view .
instead , you stay on the same page and give the list view a name in a pop - up dialog box .
you add filters to customize your list with a panel that slides out on the right side of the page . •
you can only restrict list views by selecting all or my .
other options , such as restricting by queue , campaign , or price book , are n’t available . •
for filter criteria , only these relative date ranges are supported : today , tomorrow , yesterday , this week , this month , this quarter , this year , last week , last month , last quarter , last year . •
list views in lightning experience do n’t support starts with  as a filter criterion for id fields .
an id field is a 15-character field that identifies a record .
for example , the account id  field on the contact object identifies which account a contact is associated with .
you can use starts with  as a filter criterion for other fields .
inline editing inline editing of fields on a record ’s details tab is available in lightning experience .
but it ’s not possible to edit individual fields in the highlights panel on a record , or fields in list views .
sales features : what ’s not in lightning experience person accounts ( beta ) • person accounts are n’t accessible from setup .
switch to salesforce classic to set up and configure person accounts . •
person accounts are included in all account and contact lookup results even when not applicable .
for example , the account lookup field on a contact record includes person accounts even though person accounts ca n’t be a contact ’s account . •
when hovering over a person account link , the quick view display differs based on where the person account link is .
if the link is in the field that represents the contact ( for example name  or contact ) , then contact information is displayed .
if the link is in the field that represents an account ( for example related to  or account ) , then person account information is displayed . •
the quick actions for business accounts are included on person account page layouts even though not all business account quick actions are valid for person accounts .
for example , person account page layouts include the new contact quick action even though contacts ca n’t be associated with person accounts in this way . •
when person accounts are included in contact list views , row - level actions for accounts are displayed for person account records and row - level actions for contacts are displayed for contact records .
depending on how your org ’s sharing and visibility settings are configured , users might see different actions for person accounts and contacts in their contact list views . •
in some lookup fields , account or contact icons are shown instead of the person account icon .
• communities created from a community builder – based template do n’t always properly link users to person account records .
specifically , when a user clicks a person account from a contact lookup field , they ’re redirected to a person contact record instead of a person account record . •
in contact lookup fields , person accounts do n’t appear in the list of most recent records .
person accounts do appear in lookup fields when they are searched .
however , you must enter the full value of the person account 's first name .
partial searches and wildcards are n’t supported . •
when creating a case for a person account and users add the person account to either the contact name  or account name field , the other field does n’t auto - populate with the person account until the case is saved . •
when creating an email from a person account record , the to field does n’t auto - populate with the person account 's email address the way it does when creating an email from a contact record . •
when using a template to compose an email from a business account , the template could include person account merge fields , which prevents the email from being sent .
similarly , when using a template to compose an email from a person account , the template could include business account merge fields , which prevents the email from being sent .
87 salesforce spring ’16 release notes lightning
experience considerations •
if using merge fields in an email to a person account , the contact merge fields do n’t show up in the merge field search results .
instead , contact merge fields must be entered manually .
campaigns • campaign results across hierarchies • campaign influence • cloning campaign members • adding multiple campaign members from list views leads it ’s now possible to change a lead 's owner to a queue .
but all active queues are displayed , not just queues for leads .
opportunity teams in spring ’16 , opportunity teams can be viewed , updated , or deleted in lightning experience , but switch back to salesforce classic to : • access setup pages for opportunity teams .
• change the team member display order .
• work with default opportunity teams .
• mass assign or re - assign opportunity team members . • display access levels for all team members or delete all team members with a single button . •
add multiple opportunity team members on a single page .
opportunity products opportunities with products ca n't be cloned .
productivity features : what ’s not in lightning experience home home shows upcoming events for the current day and includes a link to see all events scheduled for the day .
but home does n’t include a full calendar like is available on the salesforce classic home page .
instead , access the calendar item from the navigation menu .
global actions menu
the contents of the global actions menu in lightning experience is pulled from global actions in the salesforce1 and lightning experience actions section on the global publisher layout .
currently , only actions with these action types are supported in this menu . •
log a call • create a record — for events , notes , and tasks other global actions on the global publisher layout , including those that create records for custom objects or accounts or opportunities , do n’t appear in this menu .
integrated email integrated email is fully supported for the account , campaign , case , contact , leads , and opportunity objects only , and not for custom objects .
the person account record type is partially supported : it does not offer contact merge fields .
from records for those objects , you can send email to contacts , leads , and users maintained in salesforce , as well as to any valid external email address .
fields available for templates are based on the object from which the template is created , plus user fields .
for example , if you have an opportunity record open and create a template , you can add only opportunity and user fields to your template .
similarly , email templates created for one object are not available for use from other objects .
for example , templates created for use with the lead object are not available for emails sent from opportunity records . 88 salesforce spring ’16 release notes lightning
experience considerations customer service features : what ’s not in lightning experience learn about some new considerations when using cases in lightning experience close case layout for simplicity , the close case layout is n’t available , but you can add closed statuses to case edit pages .

you can access the assets object home from the app launcher and individual asset records from the object home , search , and related lists .

users can create and view reports for all standard objects .
reports related to objects not yet supported in lightning experience open directly in the new interface and behave like any other report .
filtered dashboards users ca n’t create , edit , or delete filtered dashboards , or add , change , or remove dashboard filters in lightning experience .
however , users can view filtered dashboards .
filtered dashboards always open with no filters applied .
it ’s possible to apply or clear filters that were added in salesforce classic .
table charts to create table charts , users must switch to salesforce classic .
table charts display in lightning experience , but they do n’t show totals .
funnel charts funnel charts from salesforce classic display correctly on reports .
but they display as bar charts on dashboards .
files and content : what ’s not in lightning experience file syncing file syncing is n’t available in lightning experience .

people and profiles users with chatter external licenses ca n’t edit their profiles .
navigation and actions : what ’s not in lightning experience lightning experience navigation menu replaces the tab bar the concept of tabs that represent objects does n’t exist in lightning experience .
the new interface updates the old salesforce classic tab bar with a collapsible navigation menu that ’s located along the left side of the page .
the default navigation menu provides access to the standard salesforce objects that are available in lightning experience , as well as home , chatter items ( the main feed , people , and groups ) , files , dashboards , reports , and the user ’s task list and calendar .
apps and custom objects available from the app launcher by default , apps ( including salesforce tabset apps and connected apps ) and custom objects are n’t included in the default lightning experience navigation menu .
if your org uses the default navigation menu , users can access these items from the app launcher , by clicking in the header .
custom objects appear in the list of other items .
even though lightning experience does n’t use the salesforce classic tab paradigm , you still need to create custom object tabs to ensure that your custom objects are available in the new interface .
custom lightning experience navigation menus support most apps and objects you can create custom lightning experience navigation menus and assign them to user profiles , giving different types of users a navigation menu that ’s tailored to their business needs .
with some exceptions , you can include many of the apps , objects , and other tabs ( including visualforce tabs and lightning component tabs ) that appear in the lightning experience app launcher .
you can include these salesforce objects in custom navigation menus : accounts , assets , campaigns , cases , contacts , files , dashboards , events , knowledge articles , leads , opportunities , price books , products , reports , tasks , tenants , work orders , and your custom objects .
you can also add home , the main chatter feed , groups , and people .

changes that you make to the salesforce1 navigation menu have no impact on the default or custom lightning experience navigation menus , and vice versa .
open links in new browser windows or tabs in general , lightning experience supports right - click and windows or mac keyboard shortcuts to open links in new browser windows or tabs .
however , these options are n’t supported in some areas of the app , including : • links in the top deals and recent records cards on home • action icons , buttons , and menu items on records • links to notes • view report links on dashboards •
links on setup pages in lightning experience shortcuts do work to open nodes from the setup menu into a new tab or window .
however , the schema builder and data import nodes open in salesforce classic instead of in lightning experience . 90 salesforce spring ’16 release notes lightning

however , related lookup filters , which restrict the valid values and search results , are supported .
for example .
configure the account owner  lookup field to only show active users on the same record .

when coordinators select a patient name from the ehr system , salesforce creates all the records and objects necessary to start managing that patient .
so for each patient , salesforce performs the following actions : • creates the patient as an individual , based on the fields you ’ve mapped from the ehr system .
an individual is an object view of both account and contact linked by the individual id .
• creates an account for the individual that is linked to the patient id / mrn field .
• creates a contact record for the individual that is linked to the account through the individual id .
• creates a case with a careplan record type so that the page layout for the care plan appears automatically .
if a care coordinator has been selected , the coordinator becomes the owner of the case .
• adds the case that represents the care plan to the account record .
• creates a case team with the individual as the patient , and adds the care coordinator , if one has been selected .
• adds the patient ’s account id to the candidate patient record .

core sales features : help reps sell using lightning experience note :  this release contains a beta version of person accounts in lightning experience , which means it ’s a high - quality feature with known limitations .
because person accounts store information you ’d typically save for business contacts , such as first name and last name , you can usually treat a person account like a contact .
for example , send an email to a person account or assign a person account to a task .
but person accounts can sometimes work like business accounts .
for example , you can add opportunities to person accounts .
the unique person account icon is your cue that the record is neither an account nor a contact —
it ’s much more .
it ’s a person account .
for more information about setting up person accounts , see “
enable person accounts ” in the salesforce help .
to learn about how person accounts work with other salesforce features , see “ person account behaviors ” in the salesforce help .

do more with lightning experience for example , our sales rep , joan , is working a deal while getting a return call from a lead she ’s nurturing .
joan wants to log the call right away without navigating elsewhere .
she clicks in the header ( 1 ) and types comments in the composer window ( 2 ) that opens on the page .
joan also relates the call to the appropriate lead record ( 3 ) .
and then she ’s back to the deal ( 4 ) , right where she left off .
but wait !
our sales rep gets a great idea how to convert that lead .
but it requires updating a presentation deck and getting colleagues on board .
the good news is that joan can fire off multiple global actions at the same time .
so she writes a note about her idea and creates a task to update the presentation .
and joan even sets up a meeting with her sales team — all from separate composer windows that open side - by - side .
composer windows dock along the bottom of the page .

allow reps to more accurately share their availability by letting them sync their private events between salesforce and their calendar applications .
regardless of whether you enable this feature , your reps experience some changes in how their private events sync staring in spring ’16 .
make sure you understand these changes , and communicate them to your reps .
after you turn on private event sync , new and existing events that reps mark as private begin syncing according to the settings you ’ve determined in the rep ’s configuration .
private events begin syncing whether they ’re created or updated in salesforce or the reps’ calendar applications .
when private events start syncing , certain private event details are visible to reps’ colleagues and supervisors depending on which system events are viewed in , and how reps have set their calendar sharing settings in salesforce .
user permissions to create , edit , or delete exchange sync configurations : • “ view setup and configuration ” and “ manage email client configurations ”
in salesforce , private event start and end times are visible to colleagues , but event details are hidden .
all private event details are visible to salesforce administrators who can view , edit , and report on events .
reps can choose to share more private event details with their colleagues by changing their calendar sharing level in their personal settings .
in your calendar application , private event details are shared with colleagues and supervisors as they always have been .
refer to that calendar application documentation for more information .
regardless of whether you decide to turn private event sync on or leave it off , all reps experience changes with how their private events sync between salesforce and their calendar applications .
prior to spring ’16 , whether private events synced depended on when the event was marked as private .
( if the event was marked as private when it was created , it was n’t synced .
if an existing event that was already syncing was later changed to private , it did sync . )
starting in spring ’16 , even when you leave private event sync off , private events that were being synced continue to sync until a rep updates the event in either system .
after the event is updated , the new private event sync setting takes effect and the event does not sync again .
a version of the private event remains in both salesforce and the rep ’s calendar until the rep deletes one or both of them .
important :  your reps wo n’t receive alerts or updates about how their private events sync starting in spring ’16 .
once you decide whether you ’re turning on the private event sync feature , it ’s important that you communicate which experience they ’ll have so they ’ll know what to expect . communicating how private events sync lets reps prepare their calendars to sync with salesforce .
and guarantees you keep great aunt alberta ’s 95th birthday party out of your salesforce org .
follow these steps to sync sales reps’ private events . 1 .

connect for office : end of support
when salesforce disables tls 1.0 , we ’re ending support for connect for office .
when salesforce disables tls 1.0 , we ca n’t guarantee that connect for office can establish a connection with salesforce when sales teams attempt to access the following features . • microsoft word add - in that lets reps create templates using salesforce data for mail merge • activex control that generates mail merges from microsoft word • microsoft excel
add - in that lets reps access salesforce reports with microsoft excel even if your reps do establish a connection using connect for office , salesforce will no longer provide support or maintenance when there is an issue .
reps can remove connect for office from their systems by uninstalling the feature .
mail merge : end of support
when salesforce disables tls 1.0 , we ’re ending support for standard mail merge .
salesforce continues to support extended mail merge , and encourages reps to transition to this feature .
mail merge was an installed feature that let sales reps generate mail merges directly from microsoft word .
when salesforce disables tls 1.0 , we ca n’t guarantee that mail merge can establish a connection between salesforce and word .
even if reps are able to establish a connection , salesforce will no longer provide support or maintenance when there is an issue .
salesforce continues to support extended mail merge , and encourages reps to transition to this feature .
extended mail merge is different from mail merge because it lets reps generate mail merges from the cloud , and functions no matter which operating systems reps are working from .
and because it works from the cloud , reps do n’t have to install anything to use it .
extended mail merge does n’t create mail merge templates automatically , but reps can create templates in word manually , upload them to salesforce , and generate mail merges directly from salesforce records .
reps can learn how to create templates manually using the “ url to locate record field names for mail merge ” article .
the article describes how reps can generate a list of salesforce field labels for reference in their templates .

creating datasets
with wave connector for excel no longer requires special admin setup we ’ve made it easier than ever to use the salesforce wave connector to import data from microsoft excel .
enrich your datasets with derived fields derived fields let you add more information to a dataset than what is extracted from a data source .
for example , add a derived field that categorizes your opportunities into small , medium , and large based on the extracted opportunity amount .
use derived fields to add more context to the data , create groupings , and perform calculations in advance .
derived fields in a dataset behave just like other fields that are extracted from an input data source — you can query them , filter by them , and group by them .
the benefit of generating values in derived fields instead of a query is that the values are immediately available to all users who have access to the dataset .
in addition , it saves users time trying to create the queries .
you can add the following transformations to a dataflow to create derived fields .
computeexpression performs calculations based on fields within the same row of the dataset .
you can assign a value to the field based on the value of another field , concatenate multiple text fields , or perform mathematical calculations on numeric fields .
for example , you can categorize opportunities based on their amount .
when you define a derived field in the dataflow , you specify the field name , type , and saql expression used to calculate its value .
the expression can be based on one or more fields from the input data or from other derived fields .
computerelative performs calculations based on the same field in other rows in the dataset .
you can calculate the first , previous , current , and next values of a field to determine the changes in value .
for example , to analyze sales pipeline trends , you can calculate the changes in the opportunity amount throughout the stages of each opportunity .
160 salesforce spring ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level when you define a computerelative transformation , you specify an sfdcdigest transformation as the input , partition the records , and sort the records within each partition .
for example , you can use sfdcdigest to extract opportunity history records , and then use computerelative to calculate changes in each opportunity over time .
you can partition opportunity records by opportunity id , and then chronologically sort records within each partition to correctly identify the previous and next values .
you must specify the computerelative transformation directly after the associated sfdcdigest transformation in the dataflow json .
because wave merges the logic from computerelative into the associated sfdcdigest , apply sfdcregister on sfdcdigest to add the fields from both transformations to the dataset .
note :  you can use this transformation in a replication dataflow .
for more information about replication , see getting started with wave replication .
computeexpression transformation example let ’s look at an example where you group your opportunities into small , medium , and large categories based on amount .
first , create an opportunity dataset by using an sfdcdigest transformation to extract the opportunity name and amount from the opportunity object .
next , use the computeexpression transformation to add the opportunity size derived field to the opportunity dataset based on the following rules . •
if amount < $ 10,000 , opportunity size = small •
if amount > = $ 10,000 and < $ 50,000 , opportunity size = medium •
if amount > = $ 50,000 , opportunity size = large to create the derived field , add the following computeexpression transformation to the dataflow .
" create_opportunity_size_derived_field " : { ] } } with the new opportunity size field , the opportunity dataset looks like this : 161 " action " : " computeexpression " , " parameters " : { " source " : " opportunity_data " , " mergewithsource " : true , " computedfields " : [ { " name " : " size " , " type " : " text " , " label " : " opportunity size " " saqlexpression " : " case end " } when amount < 10000 then \"small\ " when amount > = 10000 and amount < 50000 then \"medium\ " else \"large\ "
salesforce spring ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level computerelative transformation example let ’s look at an example where you want to analyze your sales pipeline .
to start , add an sfdcdigest transformation to extract the following data from the opportunityhistory object .
next , add a computerelative transformation to perform the following tasks .
• partition the extracted records by opportunity id . •
within each partition , sort the extracted records by createddate in ascending order .
sorting by createddate ensures that the changes that occur for each opportunity are listed in chronological order . •
add the following derived fields to the final dataset .
opportunitycreateddate determines the date that the opportunity was first created .
you can use this date with the actual close date to determine the number of days required to close the sale .
the goal is to shorten the sales cycle to recognize revenue .
validtodate determines the date to which the state of the opportunity is valid .
you can use this field to determine the time period for which the opportunity details are valid in each record .
amountprev determines the previous amount of the opportunity .
you can use this field to determine if the values of opportunities are increasing or decreasing , which can affect whether you hit your sales targets .
closedateprev determines the previous expected close date for the opportunity .
you can use this field to analyze how the expected close date changes over the sales cycle of the opportunity .
if the expected close date keeps getting pushed out , identify the issues that are causing the longer sales cycle .
to build the final dataset with extracted fields from sfdcdigest and derived fields from computerelative , add an sfdcregister transformation with sfdcdigest as the input source .
you create the following dataflow .
{ " extractopphistory " : { " action " : " sfdcdigest " , " parameters " : { " object " : " opportunityhistory " , " fields " : [ { " name " : " opportunityid " } , { " name " : " createddate " } , { " name " : " stagename " } , { " name " : " amount " } , { " name " : " closedate " } 162 salesforce spring ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level ] } } , " computetrending " : { " action " : " computerelative " , " parameters " : { " partitionby " : [ " opportunityid " ] , " orderby " : [ " name":"createddate " , " direction":"asc " ] , " computedfields " : [ { } { } , { } , { } , { } } " name " : " opportunitycreateddate " , " expression " : { " sourcefield " : " createddate " , " offset " : " first ( ) " , " default " : " current ( ) " } " name " : " validtodate " , " expression " : { " sourcefield " : " createddate " , " offset " : " next ( ) " , " default " : " 3000 - 01 - 01t00:00:00.000z " " name " : " amountprev " , " expression " : { " sourcefield " : " amount " , " offset " : " previous ( ) " , " default " : " 0 " " name " : " closedateprev " , " expression " : { " sourcefield " : " closedate " , " offset " : " previous ( ) " , " default " : " 01/01/1970 " } } ] , " source " : " extractopphistory " } } , " register_oppportunityhistory_dataset " : { " action " : " sfdcregister " , " parameters " : { " alias " : " salespipelinetrending " , 163 salesforce spring ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level " name " : " sales pipeline trending " , " source " : " extractopphistory " } } } after you run the dataflow , the final dataset looks like this .
notice that wave partitions the records by opportunity id and then sorts the records in ascending order within each partition , based on the createddate field .
wave uses the sort order within each partition to calculate the derived field values .
you can use the final dataset to determine changes to a field values .

better organized sales wave configuration wizard now lets you control security settings the app configuration wizard , now organized into four pages , lets you choose whether to apply security settings using role - level hierarchy .
we ’ve added the following question to the sales wave analytics app configuration wizard : “
do you want members of your team to be able to view only data owned by them or their subordinates ? ”
by answering “
yes , ” you apply security settings according to your salesforce org ’s role - level hierarchy , which restricts access to data .
if you say “ no , ” all sales wave users can view all the data available through the app .
also , we ’ve reorganized the wizard to make it easier to use .
wizard questions are now divided into four pages , as follows : • page 1 : questions about the accounts object • page 2 : questions about the opportunities object • page 3 : questions about the products object • page 4 : questions about fiscal start date , quotas data , and security 165 salesforce spring ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level pipe activity and account summary dashboards added to sales wave app gain even more insights into your salesforce data from sales wave through with two new prebuilt dashboards . sales wave customers have asked for additional functionality , and we ’ve obliged by adding two new prebuilt dashboards to the app : • pipe activity ( partial view shown below ) , which you can use to benchmark open versus won deals to help determine best practices for accelerating deals . •
account summary , which summarizes an account ’s average win rate , average sale cycle , and open and won totals .

if needed , you can add a container widget . •
the new designer does n’t currently support the following chart types .
– calendar heat map – dot plot ( horizontal or vertical ) – heat map – matrix – parallel coordinates – pivot table you can clip these chart types to a dashboard or add them to the dashboard json .
however , the new designer converts each unsupported chart to a horizontal bar chart , except for the pivot table , which converts to a compare table .
• widgets in the new designer ca n’t overlap , except for a widget inside a container widget . •
to add a widget in the new designer , drag it onto the canvas and then drop the clipped lens on top . •
when you create or save a dashboard in the new designer , the dashboard json contains a new gridlayouts section .
the section defines the dashboard layout in web browsers on desktop and laptop computers , but not on mobile devices .

the flex dashboard designer ( beta ) does n't support mobile layouts .
wave analytics for ios has beta support for dashboards created or saved in the flex dashboard designer .
changes when adding a link widget to a dashboard as of spring ’16 , the destination picklist field in a link widget shows only the 25 most recently opened assets .
if you create a link widget in a dashboard that ’s not saved in spring ’16 , you might not find some linked assets in the picklist .
if you ca n’t find an asset in the original designer , open the asset first , and then look for the asset in the picklist .
if you are using the new designer , manually enter the name of the asset in the destination field .
here ’s a sample picklist for a link widget when linking to a saved dashboard . 170 salesforce spring ’16 release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level customize lenses and dashboards

and now you can create lenses within the flex dashboard designer , using an integrated saql editor and a new drag - and - drop way to set up visualizations .
view saql as you explore
wave analytics uses salesforce analytics query language ( saql ) behind the scenes in lenses and dashboards to gather data for visualizations .
now you can view the underlying saql query being written as you explore .
in the explorer , click the options menu to access the show saql control .
select on to open the saql viewer .
the saql query updates as you explore , and you can copy it for use elsewhere .
for more information about saql , see the wave analytics saql reference .

this button overwrites the json of the running lens or dashboard with the json in the editor .
however , the edits are not saved until you explicitly save the lens or dashboard .
note :  expert editor mode replaces the tool at https://your_salesforce_instance / insights / web / lens.apexp .
for lenses and dashboards opened , created , or saved in the spring ‘ 16 release , use the json editor instead of the lens.apexp  page .
a lens or dashboard from a previous release can be edited in either place , but after saving in the spring ‘ 16 release , it no longer appears on the lens.apexp page .

you can also create custom relationships between work orders and other standard or custom objects .
you can view work orders on the work orders tab or the work orders related list on supported objects .
you can also add work orders as a navigation tab item in the service console .
we recommend adding work order line items to work orders to add details about the task to be performed .
work order line items represent specific tasks that a technician must perform to complete the work order .
they can mark line items as completed one by one , which makes it easier to track and improve field service processes .
you can also link a line item to a specific asset , which is helpful if you need to track the repair or replacement of a particular part .
for example : • if a customer purchases an asset from you and experiences a problem with it , you can create a work order to repair the asset . •
if a customer purchases an asset from you and covers it with a preventive service contract , you can create a work order that represents a periodic maintenance checkup .

model complex products with hierarchical assets introduce hierarchy to assets in your org to represent more complex products and track the age and status of asset components .
an asset can have up to 2,000 child assets , and a hierarchy of assets can have up to 50 levels .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
to give your users the option to make one asset the parent of another , add the following elements to your asset page layouts : • parent asset  field : lets users select a parent asset .
• root asset  field : lists the top - level asset in an asset hierarchy ( read only ) .
add this field to give users a wider view of asset hierarchies .
depending on where an asset lies in the hierarchy , its root might be the same as its parent .
if an asset is at the top of a hierarchy , it is its own root asset , and the parent asset  field is blank .
defining parent - child relationships between assets is useful if you need to represent products that are composed of multiple smaller parts .
for example , if a large machine and its components are all represented as assets in your org , you can use a parent - child structure to show which assets are components of other assets .
if your org uses a custom solution to represent asset hierarchies , we recommend adopting the new built - in asset hierarchy tools .
here are some ways to use hierarchical assets to improve your support process . •
when creating a work order to repair a broken asset , create line items on the work order that correspond to specific child assets . •
for situations where a work order is created from an asset , set up a workflow rule or process that creates a work order line item for each child asset . •
set up a trigger that notifies the owner of an asset by email when the install date for one of the asset ’s child assets was more than five years before the current date . •
create a visualforce page that gives users a bird’s - eye view of an asset hierarchy .
note :  the parent asset  and root asset  fields are n’t available in standard reports that include assets .
however , you can reference them in custom reports .

this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
developers familiar with the console api ( the salesforce console integration toolkit ) can disable a tab from closing using the disabletabclose  method .
the close - tab ( “ x ”
) icon changes to a lock icon on hover until the business rules ( such as required fields ) are satisfied .
here ’s what the tab lock looks like : you can prevent tabs from being closed in two ways : 1 . disable a primary tab .
its subtabs remain unlocked , unless disabletabclose  is invoked on them individually . 2 .
disable a subtab .
this also disables its enclosing primary tab .
some caveats and considerations : disabletabclose  is fully supported when you click the close - tab icon or when invoked via api .
other ways of invoking it are n’t fully supported and may not behave as you want them to .
macros are n’t fully supported .
if disabletabclose  is invoked via a macro , the error message might not appear , but the agent still wo n’t be able to close the tab in most cases .
and of course , we can only lead a horse to water .
an agent can still close the browser window .
but hey , ca n’t say we did n’t try ! tab behavior
when records are deleted : when a primary tab is disabled and its record is deleted , that whole set of tabs ( primary + subtabs ) automagically closes .
when a subtab is disabled and its record is deleted , the subtab remains open but refreshes as a blank tab ( although any sidebar components will render ) .

to improve agents’ experience , we now hide console components ( such as history ) that do n’t perform well in unsupported browsers .
so if your agents are using ie 8 or earlier , some console components wo n’t appear .

automatically re - route waiting requests with push time - out
when agents are n’t able to accept or reject work right away , customers can get stuck waiting for help .
we ’ve created a time - out feature that routes an item to another agent if it is n’t responded to within an established amount of time .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
to keep your customers from waiting , you can set a timer in your routing configuration for how long a request appears for an agent before the task is routed to someone else .
if they respond before the time - out , the agent is back in business .
if they do n't respond , you can set your presence configuration to automatically change their status , so they do n't receive any more requests while they 're unavailable .
customers get what they need faster , and agents do n’t have to constantly sift through their requests to make it happen .
you can set push time - out under setup > omni - channel > routing configurations , and enable status changes under setup > omni - channel > presence configurations .

to ensure a smooth transition for your org , we recommend that your users keep the os current on their devices .

version 7.3.4 , a minor bug fix release , will be available soon .
salesforce1 : tls 1.1/1.2 support for salesforce1 for android starting in 2017 , salesforce will begin disabling the tls 1.0 encryption protocol using a phased approach .
we ’re disabling tls 1.0 so we can maintain the highest security standards and promote the safety of your data .
as you work on upgrading to tls 1.1 or tls 1.2 , also consider the impact this change may have on the salesforce1 downloadable app for android and your android users .
after salesforce disables tls 1.0 , any inbound connections to , or outbound connections from , salesforce ( including salesforce1 ) will need to use the tls 1.1 or tls 1.2 encryption protocol .
what does this mean for the salesforce1 downloadable app for android ?
it depends on the os that ’s running on the android device .
• devices with android os 4.4 or greater do n't require any action to take advantage of the higher security standards of tls 1.1/1.2 .
• devices with android os 4.3 or earlier , however , do n’t support tls 1.1/1.2 .
salesforce1 for android users who haven’t upgraded to a later os wo n’t be able to perform any inbound or outbound connections after tls 1.0 is disabled .
to ensure a smooth transition , we recommend that your android users upgrade their devices to android os 4.4 or later before the phased disabling of tls 1.0 begins .
for more information , see knowledge article : salesforce disabling tls 1.0 .
salesforce1 : spell check for search results anyone who has used a mobile keyboard knows it ’s easy to make mistakes when typing .
spell check for search results is here for the assist .
when users enter a search term that does n’t yield results , they see results that match a corrected spelling of the search term .
for example , a user enters californis , which is obviously a typo , but fortunately gets results for california .
spell correction works for salesforce knowledge articles , feeds , groups , files , and chatter questions , and is available in english only .
this feature is supported in all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .
for more information , see spell correction expanded to more objects .
salesforce1 : get more relevant search results with synonym groups synonym groups have words or phrases that are treated equally in searches .
a search for one term in a synonym group returns results for all terms in the group .
for example , a search for usb returns results for all the terms in a synonym group containing usb , thumb drive , flash stick , and memory stick .
more results with less guessing !
all your synonym groups are available for salesforce knowledge articles , cases , feeds , files , and chatter questions .
this feature is available in all versions of salesforce1 .
for more details , see synonym groups enabled for more objects and maximum limit increased .

salesforce1 : how to begin implementing enhanced security for salesforce1 for android with mdm with the salesforce1 downloadable app for android , version 8.0 or later , you ’re able to tap into the enhanced security functions that come from combining salesforce1 with an mdm solution .
but since releasing the version 8.0 app , we ’ve seen some head scratching about how to start implementing these features .
there are a few pieces to the puzzle that require setup before diving into the salesforce1 end of things .
let ’s get you pointed in the right direction .
first , configure android for work for your org .
android for work is a program that supports enterprise use of android devices .
see android for work to learn more about the program and android for work help for setup information . 227 salesforce spring ’16 release notes salesforce1 : boost mobile productivity
with enhanced charts , service cloud objects , and more once android for work is set up , the next step is to configure your mobile device management ( mdm ) suite .
there are a multitude of mdm solutions in the market place .
when you decide on the right product , work with your mdm provider to complete the configuration for your org .
after you have android for work and your mdm suite up and running in your org , you ’re ready to implement the enhanced security features of the salesforce1 for android app .
to learn about configuring the key - value pair assignments for this functionality , see the mdm chapter in the salesforce1 mobile security guide .
salesforce1 : create and edit records while offline using salesforce1 for android ( pilot )
your users’ productivity does n’t have to stop when there ’s no mobile connectivity .
starting with version 9.0 of the salesforce1 downloadable app for android , your users can keep on truckin’ with their work , whether they ’re in airplane mode 30,000 feet in the sky or deep underground in a subway tunnel .
note :  offline edit for salesforce1 for android , version 9.0 is available to all customers through a public pilot program .
offline edit is n't generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
we ca n't guarantee general availability within any particular timeframe or at all .
make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available products and features .
offline edit expands on the offline support your salesforce1 for android users are already using .
currently your salesforce1 for android users can cache their recently accessed records so they can view important details within the app without a network signal .
and now , when you enable offline edit , your salesforce1 for android users can also create and edit recent records while offline .
when creating new records or updating existing records while offline , all changes are listed on the pending uploads page .
this page is available from the salesforce1 navigation menu .
when the user ’s mobile connectivity is restored , records listed on the pending uploads page are automatically synced with salesforce . if there are any sync issues that require the user ’s attention — such as conflicting changes to the same record made by a different user —
salesforce1 for android helps the user resolve the issues .
228 salesforce spring ’16 release notes salesforce1 : boost mobile productivity with enhanced charts , service cloud objects , and more because offline edit is a pilot feature , let ’s look at some important details before you take the plunge .
including how to enable enhanced offline support for your org .

visual indicators when salesforce1 for android users work offline how do salesforce1 for android users know if they ’re suddenly working online ?
how can users keep track of the records they ’ve worked on while offline , and be confident that their updates make it back to salesforce when they ’re online again ?
let ’s look at the salesforce1 visual indicators that answer these questions .
if a user ’s mobile device loses its network signal , a message briefly appears at the top of the screen .
the pending uploads page displays all the records that a user creates or edits while offline .
this page uses several indicators to show the status of offline changes . •
: displays while the mobile device is offline .

after successfully syncing , records disappear from the pending uploads page .

available data and ui elements
when salesforce1 for android is offline offline edit requires that caching for salesforce1 is turned on for your org .
as in the past , salesforce1 for android automatically caches a user ’s most recently accessed records for the objects listed in the recent section of the salesforce1 navigation menu , and a user ’s recent dashboards .
a user ’s activities in both the mobile app and the full salesforce site ( whether salesforce classic or lightning experience ) determine a user ’s recently accessed records .
in addition , the app caches much of the data that a user accesses during a salesforce1 session .
cached data is encrypted and stored in a secure , persistent data store .
here ’s the data and salesforce1 elements that are available offline .
salesforce1 element navigation menu global search notifications feeds , groups , and people salesforce today salesforce events recent
objects other objects record details related records list views tasks available for offline use yes previous searches only previously viewed only previously viewed only main page and mobile event records if previously view previously viewed only yes ( top five )

no yes cached data is refreshed when a user switches to salesforce1 .
if a user switches to another app , the user ’s cached data is automatically refreshed if the existing data store is over one hour old .
230 salesforce spring ’16 release notes salesforce1 : boost mobile productivity with enhanced charts , service cloud objects , and more users can manually cache their data at any time — for example , before switching into airplane mode or entering an area with no service .
from the salesforce1 navigation menu , select settings | offline cache | cache now .
note :  depending on the complexity and size of a user ’s records , caching can take from a few seconds to a couple of minutes .
we recommend that your users manually cache their records before going offline .

salesforce help : salesforce1 mobile app offline access offline edit limitations offline edit is available for salesforce1 for android , version 9.0 through a public pilot program .
as this offline support is n’t generally available yet , there are some limitations that you should review and prepare your users to expect . •
new and edit actions work offline .
but all other quick actions are n’t supported when offline . •
sales path is n’t supported when offline .
if sales path is enabled for your org , opportunities are n’t available offline . •
if your org has more than 15 record types for tasks , tasks are n't supported when offline . •
lookup filters are n't supported when offline .
users can enter the name of the related lookup record when editing data offline but the app does n’t search for related looked records until the user ’s mobile device is back online .
• dependent lookups and picklists for cached records are n't supported when offline , unless the user interacted with these elements before going offline . •
for performance reasons , if your org uses a lot of picklists or a very large number of fields on any of your objects’ page layouts , records for those objects are n’t cached for offline use .
if a user does n’t see recently accessed records for an object when offline , this is likely the reason why .
we 're actively working on resolving these issues so the salesforce1 offline experience is seamless when we make offline edit generally available in the future . 231 salesforce spring ’16 release notes salesforce1 : boost mobile productivity with enhanced charts , service cloud objects , and more salesforce1 : new color palette for salesforce1 for android
the salesforce1 downloadable app for android , version 9.0 introduces a new color palette that provides a consistent look and feel with lightning experience .
same as with lightning experience , salesforce1 for android now uses white and cool - toned grays , injected with a hint of salesforce blue , to create a lively and modern mood .
the sparing use of color helps keep your content center stage and eliminates visual distractions for your users .
this new color palette is n’t yet available in the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios or the salesforce1 mobile browser app .
custom branding of salesforce1 for android is still supported and any custom branding that you ’ve already applied is still there for your android users after they upgrade to version 9.0 .
if your org hasn’t already added its own unique stamp to salesforce1 , the new , neutral background of the mobile app gives you a great canvas from which to highlight your company ’s brand .
salesforce1 differences from the full salesforce site the salesforce1 mobile app does n’t have all the functionality of the full salesforce site , and also includes some features that are n’t available in the full site .
see if there are differences between salesforce1 and the full site for this release ’s new and enhanced features .
note :  for complete details about the differences for all features available in salesforce1 , see “ salesforce1 limits and differences from the full salesforce site ” in the salesforce help in the salesforce online help .
account insights • when accessing account insights on a tablet device , users ca n't scroll through the available insights like they can in lightning experience .
instead , the device 's screen size determines how many insights are displayed . •
when accessing account insights on a phone , only one insight is displayed at a time .
actions if you use url custom buttons to pass parameters to standard pages in salesforce classic — such as pre - populating fields when creating a record — this behavior does n’t work in salesforce1 or lightning experience .
232 salesforce spring ’16 release notes assets and work orders salesforce authenticator mobile app , version 2.0 , for two - factor authentication
these objects are fully supported in the salesforce1 mobile browser app , but they are n’t supported in any versions of the salesforce1 downloadable apps for android and ios .
depending on the salesforce1 for android and salesforce1 for ios version , these objects may appear in the navigation menu but we do n’t recommend using them .
there can be unexpected behavior on the assets and work orders home pages .
plus some functionality is n’t available , including : it ’s not possible to create assets or work orders , list views are n’t available on these object home pages , nor do these objects appear in search results .
enhanced charts from lightning experience • scatter and table charts are n’t supported in salesforce1 and appear as horizontal bar charts .
cumulative line charts are n’t supported and appear as line charts . •
enhanced charts show only the first 100 groupings in the under - laying report in the default sort order . •
you ca n’t post enhanced charts to chatter .
files without chatter in the salesforce1 mobile apps spring ’16 decouples salesforce files from chatter .
so it ’s now possible to use files in the salesforce1 mobile browser app , as well as the full salesforce site , if your org has disabled chatter .
however , this enhancement is n’t supported in the salesforce1 downloadable apps for android and ios .
users of the downloadable apps ca n’t access files unless chatter is enabled for your org .

salesforce authenticator mobile app , version 2.0 , for two - factor authentication
we ’ve completely reimagined , redesigned , and rebuilt the salesforce authenticator mobile app .
version 2.0 is a powerful and innovative two - factor authentication app for ios and android mobile devices .
not only does the new version of the app provide strong protection , it ’s also super easy to use .
your users enjoy enhanced security and increased convenience — all in one beautiful app .
salesforce authenticator works for lightning experience , salesforce classic , and the salesforce mobile app .
editions available in : group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , developer , and contact manager editions many mobile authenticator apps generate verification codes that expire after a certain amount of time .
when your users log in to an online account that requires two - factor authentication , they enter the code from the app along with their username and password .
like other mobile authenticator apps , salesforce authenticator generates codes for whenever your users need them .
version 2.0 of the app introduces features for added convenience , without sacrificing security .
when someone tries to log in or access restricted online data in a user ’s account , salesforce authenticator sends a notification to the user ’s mobile device .
233 salesforce spring ’16 release notes salesforce authenticator mobile app , version 2.0 , for two - factor authentication your user opens the app to see details of the online activity .
after checking the details ( 1 ) , the user taps approve to verify that the activity belongs to the user .
or if the activity is n’t recognized , the user can tap deny to block it .
salesforce authenticator gives your users the option of flagging the blocked activity for a salesforce admin to investigate .
you can view users’ verification attempts and the activities they flag for you in the new verification history table in setup .
234 salesforce spring ’16 release notes salesforcea when your users enable location services for salesforce authenticator , they unleash even more powerful features ( 2 ) .
if users are in their home or office , for example , they can tell authenticator to verify their activities automatically from that trusted location .
automation gives your users the extra security of two - factor authentication , and they do n’t even have to take their phone out of their pocket .
users download the app from the app store for iphones and google play for android devices .
before your users can use salesforce authenticator for two - factor authentication , they have to connect the app to their online account .
in salesforce , your users can connect the app to their account in their personal settings .
connecting the app does n’t mean that your users are required to use two - factor authentication every time they log in .
you set up the two - factor authentication requirement for your users in keeping with your company ’s security policies .
if you set up a two - factor authentication requirement for users before they connect salesforce authenticator to their account , they ’re prompted to connect the app the next time they log in .
if your users already have version 1 installed on their mobile device , they can download the update from the app store or google play .
the update preserves the connected accounts that the user already has in the app .
these accounts are “ code - only ” accounts that generate verification codes but do not receive push notifications or allow location - based automated verifications .
your users can recognize a code - only account on their connected accounts list in the app by the verification code that appears below the account name .
the verification codes in these code - only accounts are valid until your users connect the new 2.0 functionality to their salesforce account via their personal settings .
note :  version 2.0 of the salesforce authenticator mobile app will be available from the app store and google play following the completion of the spring ' 16 salesforce release to all production orgs on february 13 , 2016 .
the app is n’t available for preview or testing in sandbox orgs beforehand .

also , many powerful community builder and template features require the winter ’16 or spring ’16 template versions , so if you did n’t upgrade in winter ’16 , now is the time to do it .
important :  if you choose not to upgrade your template , it does n’t affect your community .
however , starting with the summer ’16 release , our customer support team ca n’t provide assistance if issues arise with outdated templates .
if you ca n’t upgrade your community template immediately , we strongly recommend that you plan for it before the summer ’16 release .
the latest versions of the koa , kokua , napili , and aloha templates use lightning technology and components , which deliver better performance and a richer visual experience .
you can edit all koa , kokua , napili , and aloha template pages and components directly in community builder .
you no longer need to use site.com studio , except for a few site configuration settings .
a few things to keep in mind : • this update affects communities that use the koa , kokua , aloha , and napili templates .
communities built using the salesforce tabs + visualforce template are n’t affected .
• updating the template can have a different impact depending on the version your community currently uses . –
if your community uses the winter ’16 koa , kokua , or napili template , your customizations are maintained for all pages except the login pages , which retain branding but lose any custom code or component customizations . –
if your community uses a pre - winter ’16 koa , kokua , or napili template , or a pre - spring ’16 aloha template , most component customizations and properties are overwritten .
for the koa and kokua self - service templates , general settings ( such as category group name , top - level category , and company name ) carry over .
for napili , topic definitions carry over .
most branding properties defined using the branding editor in community builder are maintained .
however , some community colors might be reset to the default values .
after you update the template , check the branding properties and update any that were reset .
for more information , see update your community ’s template in community builderin the salesforce help .
• template components introduced in winter ’16 and spring ’16 might not be compatible with older template versions .

which components
can i use with each template ? ” in the using templates to build communities guide .
242 salesforce spring ’16 release notes we ’ve renamed some template components compatibility with lightning experience the spring ’16 versions of koa , kokua , napili , aloha , and lightning experience use the same underlying technology : the lightning platform and lightning components .
that said , you are n’t required to enable lightning experience in your organization to upgrade your community templates .
a few considerations of note if you ’re planning to enable lightning experience in your org : • salesforce communities is available in lightning experience setup , but it is n’t fully supported in lightning experience .
lightning experience does n’t support the global header , so internal users in your org ca n’t switch between the salesforce org and their communities from lightning experience .
if you enable lightning experience in your organization , internal users must switch back to salesforce classic to access the global header . •
enabling lightning experience does n’t change the look and feel of communities that use the salesforce tabs + visualforce template , which uses the salesforce classic styling by default .
we ’ve renamed some template components we know that finding the template components you need should be easy and intuitive .
so , we renamed some of the components so that you can easily figure out what they are for .

note :  this functionality requires the winter ’16 or later version of the napili template .
to enable groups in your community , add groups to the community navigation menu .
this automatically displays a menu item that links to a list of groups in your community .
if you make the menu item publicly available , even guest users who are n’t logged in to your community can browse through the list of groups .
245 salesforce spring ’16 release notes chatter in community templates when users click on the name of an active group in the community , they ’re redirected to the group detail page .
if it ’s a private group , they ’re asked to log in .
only logged - in group members can view private group content .
a few things to keep in mind : • when you enable groups in your community , the default group detail page is used to display group data .
this page uses the group component under the hood for formatting and layout .
the group component is a composite , one - stop component that includes the group banner , group details , related lists , and the group feed .
we recommend using this composite component , especially if you want your community pages to be responsive across desktop and mobile device browsers . •
if you prefer to use a different layout or want more granular control over the placement of group content , create a custom community page and use the group banner , group details , group related list , and feed components .
depending on how you use the individual components , custom pages might not be responsive across all devices .
• group announcements are n’t supported in communities .
example :  group in a napili community .

247 salesforce spring ’16 release notes chatter in community templates new user profile component it ’s a bird , it ’s a plane , it ’s the new user profile super component !
the user profile component uses a two - column layout to include everything your users need to know about other users : contact information , profile photo , chatter statistics , topics the user is knowledgeable about , who the user is following , and the user ’s followers .
this new component is included by default in all communities created with the napili template in spring ‘ 16 or later .
the user profile component includes all the useful features we provide for user profiles , but you can customize it to meet your community needs .
profile details and the profile image are always shown , but you choose if you want to show related lists , chatter statistics , and knowledgeable about .
you can also customize labels .
the layout of the component also makes it ideal for viewing your community on a mobile device .
when viewed on a mobile device or tablet , the component uses a single column layout that includes four tabs : feed , cases , details , and related .
the cases tab is only visible when a user views their own profile .
you can edit all tab labels .
if you prefer to use a different layout or want more granular control over the placement of user profile content , create a custom community page and use the user profile summary , user profile tabs , user profile statistics , user profile knowledgeable
about , and user profile related list components
. example :  user profile component 248
salesforce spring ’16 release notes chatter in community templates show users’ related lists on profiles it ’s convenient for users to see all their information in one place .
add the user profile related list component to your user profile page so that users can see their related lists .

users can view full details for a related list by clicking view all at the bottom of the list .
on the files related list , users can click upload a file . to customize which related lists are visible in your community by editing the user profile page layout in your internal salesforce org setup .

then sit back and watch as your community starts interacting and collaborating .
previously , feeds and the feed publisher could only be used together as part of the record information tabs component on record detail pages .

allow community members to create records from any community page with a convenient button click .
note :  this functionality requires the winter ’16 or later version of the napili template . 1 .
add the create record button component to a community page .
for example , add it to the home page to make it easy to find .
2 .
in the property editor , add the global actions that you want to expose in the community and save your changes .
these global actions are the same ones used by the publisher in the internal salesforce org .
you can configure their labels , layout , and fields in setup .
after you associate a list of global actions with the button , it behaves like a drop - down menu .
when community members select and click an action from the button , they are redirected to the create new page , which uses the create new record form component .
this page dynamically picks up the global action layout associated with the clicked action and displays the appropriate record fields when the page loads .
a few things to keep in mind : • you can add up to 20 global actions to the button . •
the following objects are supported in communities : accounts , cases , contacts , leads , opportunities , tasks , events , campaigns , campaign members , and custom objects . •
you ca n’t use the create record form component on custom pages .
community members can access more actions on records use more record actions from the record banner and record related lists on the record detail page in napili .
note :  this functionality requires the winter ’16 or later version of the napili template . •
record banners : community members with the necessary permissions can follow the record and use the quick actions defined for the object from the record banner on a record detail page .
previously , they could only edit and delete records
. you can define the quick actions for each object on the object page layout in setup , and then assign those layouts to the community user profiles .
we recommend including quick actions only for the objects supported on napili . •
related record lists : users can now access row - level actions ( edit , delete , and so on ) from related record lists .
previously , related record lists only supported the creation of new related records for supported objects .
note : • custom visualforce actions are n’t supported . • community members ca n’t access record details for unsupported objects , so we recommend that you minimize the use of unsupported objects in your community .
consider removing unsupported objects from related record lists and quick actions when you define the page layout for each object you expose in the community .
257 salesforce spring ’16 release notes community templates new - and - improved record list component the record list component , previously known as record list view , is now available in full and compact layouts so you can choose the one that best meets your community needs .
the record list component now supports groups , leads , and opportunities , in addition to accounts , cases , contacts , and custom objects .
you can also add the record list component to any page in your community .
note :  this functionality requires the spring ’16 or later version of the napili template .
when creating a record list , you select the object to use .
after you select the object , the filter name field automatically populates with the available related lists .
this example shows a record list for the account object using the full layout and the all accounts related list .
the compact layout is ideal for showing short lists of information in a narrow column or when displaying your community on a mobile device .
when a page using the full layout is viewed on a mobile device , the page automatically switches to the compact layout .
when choosing the layout for record list components in your community , consider the following : • compact layout works in any size column .
for full layout , use a column width of at least 50% of the page . •
if using the full layout , we recommend that you do n’t place a component below the record list component on the page . –
full layout has a minimum height of 700 pixels .
if you place a component below the full layout of the record list component , the record list component may overlap the component below . –
full layout uses infinite scrolling .
if you reference an object that contains many records , infinite scrolling may prevent you from ever seeing the component below the record list component . •
the maximum number of items in a compact layout is 100 .
the maximum number per page in the full layout is 100 .
example :  sample record list component ( full layout ) : 258 salesforce spring ’16 release notes community templates • use the menu ( 1 ) to change the list view . • use the new button ( 2 ) to create a record .
a window pops up where a user can enter and save record details .
• use the buttons ( 3 ) to filter the list view or view related charts .
because external community users ca n’t be assigned the “
create and customize list views ” permission , they ca n’t filter list views .
sample record list component ( compact layout ) : customize tabs in the record information tabs component hide and rearrange tabs in the record information tabs component to meet your community ’s needs .
note :  this feature requires the winter ’16 or later version of the template .
previously , by default the record information component showed three tabs in a set order : record details , related records , and the feed related to the record .
you can now switch the order of the tabs , and even hide tabs your community does n’t use .
display record details where you need them most see all the important information about your accounts , cases , and other records in your napili community .
simply drag the record detail component on a record detail or a custom page , and it populates with record information stored in salesforce .
this component is a great way to share information with community members who need it most , like partners .
note :  this feature requires the winter ' 16 or later version of the template .

now to the heart of the improvements !
let ’s look at some of the other changes you ’ll notice when creating custom pages . •
when you click –

in the napili template , you can now create all the pages — record detail , list , and related list — associated with one of your salesforce objects . •
whereas you previously added the name when you created the record detail page in the napili template , now you can update the name after you create the pages .
to access the properties of each page associated with an object , select the object under salesforce object pages and click the tab you need .
273 salesforce spring ’16 release notes community builder • you can update the base url of custom object pages in napili , which ensures that all object pages share a common url prefix .
however , you ca n’t update the individual url for an object page . •
you can also create pages in the page variations section .
page variations the page variations section lets you quickly create additional versions of the selected page .
for example , you could create three different question detail pages to test out various layouts or styles .
unlike general page creation , new pages are automatically based on the appropriate default template page — in this case , napili ’s question detail page — and you can choose from several different layouts .
note :  you ca n’t add page variations for the home or error pages , or the pages grouped under login pages and generic record pages .
to create a page variation , click .
to preview , edit , or delete a page , click .

for more information on custom layouts , see the lightning components developer ’s guide .
access community builder directly from setup for communities created with a community builder - based template , you can now access community builder directly from the all communities page in setup .
fewer clicks to get you where you want to go is always a good thing . 275 salesforce spring ’16 release notes community builder add markup to the page < head > to customize your community interested in adding custom analytics to your community ’s pages ?

for example , you can customize your community ’s pages to suit your needs by adding : • custom analytics code , such as google analytics™ • seo meta tags that are visible only to search engines •
references to external javascript files and third - party libraries • custom javascript blocks • a favicon or web page icon to access the page < head > , go to the advanced section of the settings area in community builder and click edit head markup .
when you add custom markup , the code is added to the < head >  of every page .
example :  here we ’ve added html to include a favicon on our community ’s pages .
improved error handling for lightning components community builder gracefully handles issues , such as malformed urls or invalid component properties , by displaying an appropriate error message .
note :  for communities using the winter ’16 version of the koa , kokua , and napili templates , this functionality is available immediately after the spring ’16 release .
in all other cases , you must update your template to spring ’16 to use this functionality .
when a problem is detected with the parameters of a url : 276 salesforce spring ’16 release notes community builder •
the page is n’t loaded .
the default error page is displayed instead . •
the response is flagged as a 404 error for seo purposes .
when a problem is detected with the properties of a component : • a warning message replaces the component in community builder to indicate what went wrong . •
the component is hidden from view in the published community or when previewed in a separate tab .
example :  here the component ’s record id property is missing the closing curly brace—{!recordid — which causes the error .
enhanced page loading experience we 've improved the page loading experience for your community users by displaying a ghost version of your community page until the page loads completely .
previously , community users saw a blank page while waiting for the community page to load .
show loading indicator as the page loads is enabled by default in the settings area of the community builder .
however , if your page header is highly customized and the ghost version varies vastly from the real version loading in the browser , you can disable this feature .
example : hide or customize the default koa and kokua header use your own branding and custom components in the koa and kokua templates .
hide the default header and use the customizable regions above and below the header to add your own components .
note :  you must update your community ’s template to the spring ’16 version to use this functionality .
277 salesforce spring ’16 release notes community setup in community builder , click hides the default header image , the search box , the community menu , and user profile navigation menu on all the pages in your community . on the left ,
click general , and then select hide header region and navigation .
choosing this option tip :  if you choose to hide the header , consider replacing some of the hidden functionality with custom components .
for example , you can create a custom navigation menu to replace the default community navigation .
or , add a language picker to the editable header regions above and below the default header .
jquery
no longer automatically included for custom lightning components we no longer automatically include the jquery javascript library for custom lightning components used in community builder .
as a result , if your custom lightning components depend on jquery , you must manually include a link to an open - source jquery library in the < head >  markup of your community .
to include a link to a hosted library , such as the google hosted libraries : 1 .
in community builder , go to the advanced section in the settings area .
2 . click edit head markup .
3 .
copy and paste a html snippet for the hosted jquery library .
for example : < script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com / ajax / libs / jquery/2.2.2/jquery.min.js"></script >

we increased the maximum number of communities you can have in your salesforce org to 50 .
no questions asked .
previously , this limit was org - specific .
active , inactive , and preview communities , including force.com sites , count against this limit .
all orgs can see the new limit once they upgrade to the spring ’16 release .
to see this limit in your org , from setup enter communities in the quick find  box , then select all communities .
the maximum number of communities  field displays 50 .
streamlined setup of two - factor authentication for communities we ’ve simplified the process of setting up two - factor authentication at login .
you can now use profile policies and session settings to require community members to complete two - factor authentication when they log in .
previously , you had to create a custom login flow .
all salesforce user interface authentication methods , including username and password , delegated authentication , saml single sign - on , and social sign - on through a third - party authentication provider , are supported .
to require two - factor authentication for community members assigned to a particular profile , first use the session security level required at login  profile setting .
then set session security levels in your org ’s session settings to apply the policy for particular login methods . 279 salesforce spring ’16 release notes community management by default , the session security requirement at login for all profiles is none .
you can edit a profile ’s session settings to change the requirement to high assurance .
when profile users with this requirement log in with a login method ( such as username and password ) that grants standard level security instead of high assurance , they ’re prompted to verify their identity with two - factor authentication .
after community members authenticate successfully , they ’re logged in to the community .
you can edit the security level assigned to a login method in your org ’s session settings .
your community members with mobile devices can use the salesforce authenticator mobile app or another authenticator app for two - factor authentication .
if you set the high assurance  requirement on a profile , a profile user who does n’t already have salesforce authenticator or another authenticator app connected to their account is prompted to connect the app before they can log in .
after they connect the app , they ’re prompted to use the app to verify their identity .
example :  you ’ve configured facebook and linkedin as authentication providers in your community .
many of your community members use “ social sign - on ” to log in using the username and password for their facebook or linkedin accounts .
you want to increase security by requiring users with the customer community user profile to use two - factor authentication when they log in with their facebook account , but not with their linkedin account .
you edit the customer community user profile and set the session security level required at login  to high assurance .
in your org ’s session settings , you edit the session security levels . you place facebook in the standard column .
in the high assurance column , you place two - factor authentication .
you also place linkedin in the high assurance column .
note :  you can also use login flows to change the user ’s session security level to initiate identity verification under specific conditions .
login flows let you build a custom post - authentication process that meets your business requirements .

so get ready to have a new look and feel to your community management home page and mapped dashboard pages .
tip :  install the spring ’16 version of the salesforce communities management package to get preconfigured lightning - optimized dashboards for community management .
this package will be available for download on the appexchange shortly after the spring ’16 release .
this package works in the following communities : salesforce tabs + visualforce , koa , kokua , and napili . 287 salesforce spring ’16 release notes community insights and analytics how does all this magic work ?
we ’ve changed the default display for all dashboards in community management from salesforce classic to lightning experience .
all dashboards in community management display as lightning dashboards regardless of what type of dashboard you ’re using or what interface your org is using .
remember that the communities product is not supported in lightning experience .
we ’re just giving your dashboards a makeover by leveraging a lightning display .
the appexchange package provides preconfigured salesforce classic dashboards that are optimized for this lightning display .
to keep things short and simple , we call these dashboards lightning - optimized dashboards .
here ’s a breakdown of the different types of dashboards and what the appexchange package delivers .
• salesforce classic dashboards — created in your salesforce classic org • lightning experience dashboards — created in your lightning experience org ( not delivered in the appexchange package ) • lightning - optimized dashboards — created in your salesforce classic org , but configured to optimally render in a lightning display ( delivered in the appexchange package )
all dashboard types are supported in community management , we just recommend using the lightning - optimized dashboards provided in the appexchange package .
what happens when i install the package ?
during package installation , dashboard folders are installed in your org and one of two things happens . •
if you already have dashboards mapped , you must manually update your dashboard mappings to use the new lightning - optimized dashboards . •
if this is your first time installing the package or you do n’t have dashboards mapped in community management , the lightning - optimized dashboards are automatically mapped for you .
do i have to do anything ?
yes .
after you install the package , verify that your dashboard mappings are using the new lightning - optimized dashboards .
in community management , go to the dashboards > settings page and check that the mapped dashboards are from the lightning communities dashboards folder .
288 salesforce spring ’16 release notes community insights and analytics remember , not all browsers support lightning dashboards .
review the supported browsers and make sure you ’re ready .
can i customize these dashboards ?
of course you can !
in your salesforce org , click the dashboards tab and then select the dashboard from the list .
make sure you review the limitations and considerations below .
are there limitations or considerations ?
for a salesforce classic dashboard to work as a lightning - optimized dashboard , it must meet the following requirements : • include up to 20 reports arranged within three columns • does n’t include unsupported charts , such as funnel , scatter , table , multi - metric , pie , and gauge for a list of dashboard features not available in lightning experience , see reports and dashboards : lightning experience limitations in the salesforce help .
if you want to continue using the salesforce classic dashboards that were previously mapped in community management , know that some dashboard design features wo n’t optimally render in the lightning display .
for example , metric reports display as large tiles .
it ’s recommended that you edit these dashboards to provide a better user experience for your community managers .
you might want to remove the metric reports from the dashboards .
considerations for orgs using lightning experience : • keep in mind that after saving a dashboard in lightning experience , you ca n’t edit it in salesforce classic .
for this reason , we recommend that you re - create the lightning - optimized dashboards in lightning experience . •
you can use the lightning - optimized dashboards provided in the package , but know that more power is at your fingertips .
because your org is using lightning experience , you can re - create the lightning - optimized dashboards in your org to take full advantage of the lightning experience capabilities .
you do n’t need to use optimized dashboards when you can have the real deal .
keep in mind that the communities product is not supported in lightning experience .
considerations for orgs using salesforce classic : if you are an advanced user and you do n’t want to use the lightning - optimized dashboards but want the real thing instead , use this workaround .
first , create the lightning experience dashboards in a developer edition org with lightning experience enabled .
then deploy them as an unmanaged package or configure them using the dashboard settings node .
to update these dashboards , redeploy the package with your updates .

306 salesforce spring ’16 release notes chatter messenger : retiring in spring depending on when your org gets the release and when your users get their digests , some users could receive two digests with the same content .
for example , users who got their personal digest in the 12 hours before the release receive the enhanced version of the same digest shortly after the release .
thereafter , personal digests conform to your users’ normal digest schedule .
while no setup is required for the digest changes , consider improving your users’ experience by creating custom compact layouts .
the personal digest uses an object ’s primary compact layout to determine which fields are displayed .
you can create a custom compact layout and set it as the primary .
we recommend limiting the total number of fields to four or fewer .
users see only fields that they have access to .
note these field value limitations : • field values are not localized •
some data types , such as checkboxes , are not rendered optimally tip :  to take advantage of the enhanced digest and to streamline email volume , we recommend that your users : • set personal digest frequency to daily • change daily and weekly group digests to never •
do n’t change group digests set to email on every post see also : salesforce help : compact layouts chatter messenger :

315 salesforce spring ’16 release notes upload files to notes & attachments list in salesforce classic upload files to notes & attachments list in salesforce classic files that you upload to the notes & attachments related list on records in salesforce classic are now salesforce files objects , rather than the old attachment objects .
a new org pref in salesforce files settings controls this behavior , and is enabled by default for new orgs .
this feature is helpful for orgs that want to migrate from attachments to files , but still need to keep their existing notes and attachments .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
attachments and salesforce files are two different types of objects .
attachments are files uploaded to the notes & attachments related list on records ; they exist in salesforce only in the context of the record they ’re attached to .
they ’re not available for sharing , adding to libraries , or in any other context .
salesforce files are what you upload to files home , in feeds , and anywhere else you add files in salesforce .
we introduced the files related list in winter ‘ 16 for customers who want to make the move from the older - style attachments to feature - rich salesforce files .
since many customers still need access to their existing notes and attachments , we ’ve kept the notes & attachments related list .
when you upload a file to the notes & attachments list in lightning experience , it becomes a salesforce file , not an attachment .
but the files you ’ve been uploading to the same list in salesforce classic were still attachments .
still reading ?
good !
now , when your users upload a file to the notes & attachments related list on a record in salesforce classic , it becomes a salesforce file .
this does n’t change who can see the file , but it does mean the file can have hopes and dreams no attachment could ever have .
it can be shared with people , groups , libraries , and companies .
it can be posted in feeds , synced , and updated with new versions .
it ’s going to get all kinds of love it could n’t get before .
the new behavior of files uploaded to the notes & attachments related list is enabled by default for new orgs .
existing orgs can enable it with a new preference in salesforce files general settings .
( from setup , enter salesforce files  in the quick find  box , then select general settings . )
this setting only affects the notes & attachments related list in salesforce classic .
new “

the set by record access level means that access to the file is determined by the level of access to the record that the file is linked to .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .

when a file is linked to a record using the inferred sharing type via the api , sharing settings ( in salesforce classic ) and share file ( in lightning experience ) show set by record as the level of access when you share the file .

when you create a synonym group , the group is enabled for all supported objects .
synonym groups have words or phrases that are treated equally in searches .
a search for one term in a synonym group returns results for all terms in the group .
for example , a search for usb returns results for all the terms in a synonym group containing usb , thumb drive , flash stick , and memory stick .
because more objects are supported , the setup page to manage synonym groups changed from knowledge synonyms to synonyms in salesforce classic . admins make changes to synonyms in the salesforce classic setup .

your org ’s custom objects and apps • most standard objects
even if the objects are n’t supported in lightning experience yet , you can add many of them to navigation menus .

you start by naming the navigation menu .
the the wizard displays a list of all items that can appear on a navigation menu .

333 salesforce spring ’16 release notes general administration that ’s it !
you ’ve created a custom navigation menu .
now , clone this one and use it as a template for the next navigation menu .
considerations for custom navigation menus keep in mind these considerations when planning to create lightning experience custom navigation menus for your org .
the default lightning experience navigation menu never goes away lightning experience includes a default navigation menu that ’s assigned to all your users .
this menu lists and orders items as in the winter ’16 release , and you ca n’t edit it .
if you remove a custom navigation menu from a user profile without replacing it with another one , the profile switches to the default menu .
if you delete a custom navigation menu , all user profiles that were assigned to that menu revert to the default menu .
you assign only one navigation menu to a user profile if you assign a navigation menu to a user profile that already has a menu assigned to it , the new menu overrides the previous one .
users belonging to that profile immediately see the new navigation menu .
keep that in mind as you create more navigation menus .
if a user suddenly sees a different navigation menu , you could get calls from some confused users .
you can assign a navigation menu to multiple user profiles you tailor navigation menus for different types of users by assigning the menus to user profiles .
you can assign a navigation menu to several user profiles .
for example , you can assign an inside sales - centric navigation menu to all profiles involved with your inside sales teams .
your edition determines how many custom navigation menus you can assign
for all editions , except professional edition , you can assign up to 10 custom navigation menus .
professional edition allows a total of five menus .
navigation menus can list up to 100 items if a menu contains too many items , it becomes less useful .
but you can list up to 100 items on a single navigation menu .
salesforce apps with multiple tabs are appear as separate tabs in navigation menus for apps that have multiple tabs ( formerly called tab sets ) , each tab appears as a separate item on the available items list .
hunt through the list to find all the related tabs to keep them together on the navigation menu .
of course , you can take this opportunity to be selective .
you do n’t have to list all the app ’s tabs on the menu .
334 salesforce spring ’16 release notes general administration navigation menus respect user permissions if a user does n’t have permission to access an object , it does n’t appear on the navigation menu .
navigation menus can contain objects
not supported in lightning experience lightning experience is a work in progress .
more objects are becoming available with each release , but a few objects still are n’t supported .
even if the objects are n’t yet supported in lightning experience you can still add many of them to navigation menus .
when clicked , the object opens in salesforce classic in another tab .
however , not all unsupported objects can appear on navigation menus .
no worries — the wizard lists only available objects , so you do n’t have to keep track of them yourself .
if you ’re curious , see lightning experience limitations for the latest list of unsupported objects .
url custom button and link support in lightning experience and salesforce1 custom buttons and links that define their content source as url  are now supported in lightning experience and the salesforce1 mobile app .
this feature was previously available in salesforce classic only .

your picklist data stays clean , because users ca n’t add erroneous or redundant values .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
here ’s another reason to try restricted picklists : you can take advantage of them in custom metadata types .
custom metadata types are custom - defined types of application metadata that can be packaged and used along with an app .
they save time by letting you define configurations and create reusable app components and features .
picklists on custom metadata types are always restricted , so enable restricted picklists to use custom metadata types .
editions available in : developer edition and sandboxes by default , and all other editions with pilot participation .
note : if you have a developer edition org or sandbox org , no setup is required to use restricted picklists . you can package restricted picklists with an app only in developer edition or sandbox orgs .
for all other editions , restricted picklists are available as a beta feature , which means they ’re highly functional but have known limitations .
contact salesforce to enable restricted picklists .
you define the list of values for a picklist when you create the custom picklist field .
however , users can introduce other values by loading them through the api .
to enable validation of picklist values against the defined list of values , select strictly enforce picklist values .
this prevents users from adding values through the api .

lightning experience : a new , modern , intelligent user experience change in how the recent items component ’s entitynames values are listed if you ’re a developer creating lightning pages in xml , this feature update is for you !
lightning component attributes that are complex values are now represented as json .
the attributes are now handled as real data types , not just as strings .
this feature is available in salesforce1 and lightning experience .
of the standard components available for lightning pages , only the recent items component is affected by this change .
the values of the recent items component property entitynames  are now stored as json rather than a comma - separated list .
so , in your recent items components , instead of listing objects like this account , obj__c  in your page xml , you now need to list them like this [ " account , obj__c " ]

data loader we ’ve released a new version of data loader !
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
the new version of data loader now supports web server oauth authentication for both windows and mac , which provides an extra layer of security compliance .
also the data loader for windows installer now includes the log-conf.xml  file .
the log-conf.xml  is located at % localappdata%\salesforce.com\data loader\samples\conf\log - conf.xml  for the current user , and 357 salesforce spring ’16 release notes lightning connect c:\program files ( x86)\salesforce.com\data loader\samples\conf\log - conf.xml  for all users .
the log-conf.xml  lets you implement enhanced logging .
note :  salesforce no longer bundles java with the data loader for windows installer .
download and install java on your windows computer .
we recommend that you set the java_home  environment variable to the directory where the java runtime environment ( jre ) is installed .
doing so ensures that you can run data loader in batch mode from the command line .
system requirements for windows to use data loader for windows , you need : •
microsoft® windows® 7 or windows xp • 120 mb of free disk space • 256 mb of available memory • java jre 1.8 ( 32-bit ) system requirements for mac os to use data loader for mac , you need : • mac® os x • 120 mb of free disk space • 256 mb of available memory • java jre 1.8 • administrator privileges on the machine important :  starting in the first quarter 2016 , salesforce will begin disabling the tls 1.0 encryption protocol .
after salesforce disables tls 1.0 , any inbound connections to , or outbound connections from salesforce will need to use the tls 1.2 encryption protocol .
this change impacts api - based software that salesforce makes available for download , such as data loader .
the spring ' 16 version of data loader has been enhanced to support tls 1.2 .
to maintain access to data loader , you must upgrade to the spring ' 16 version of data loader and java jre 1.8 .
we recommend that you begin planning to support tls 1.2 as soon as possible .

is determined by the credentials lightning connect uses to connect that user to the provider org .
which credentials are used is determined by the identity type of the external data source definition on the subscriber org .
those credentials are associated with a specific user on the provider org .
if that user on the provider org has the " view encrypted data " permission , users on the subscriber org who are connected with those credentials can view encrypted data on the provider org .
for example , suppose the salesforce admin for the provider org has encrypted the account name field . •
if the subscriber org user is connected via lightning connect as a provider org user with the " view encrypted data " permission , they see the account name field contents as plaintext . •
if the subscriber org user is connected via lightning connect as a provider org user without the " view encrypted data " permission , the account name field contents are masked ( that is , the values are replaced with asterisks ) .

process builder criteria are evaluated in the order shown on the canvas .
when criteria are true , the process executes the associated action group and stops evaluating additional criteria .
when criteria are false , the process skips the action group and evaluates the criteria for the next action group .
it ’s easy to reorder your criteria .
let ’s say you change some criteria to always execute the associated actions .
this means that no subsequent criteria in your process will be evaluated .

you can apply the two - factor authentication requirement to users in salesforce orgs and communities .
to require two - factor authentication for users assigned to a particular profile , edit the session security level required at login  profile setting .
then set session security levels in your org ’s session settings to apply the policy for particular login methods . by default , the session security requirement at login for all profiles is none .
you can edit a profile ’s session settings to change the requirement to high assurance .
when profile users with this requirement log in with a login method ( such as username and password ) that grants standard level security instead of high assurance , they ’re prompted to verify their identity with two - factor authentication .
after users authenticate successfully , they ’re logged in to salesforce .
you can edit the security level assigned to a login method in your org ’s session settings .
users with mobile devices can use the salesforce authenticator mobile app or another authenticator app for two - factor authentication .
internal users can connect the app to their account in the advanced user details page of their personal settings .
if you set the high assurance  requirement on a profile , profile users who do n’t already have salesforce authenticator or another authenticator app connected to their account are prompted to connect the app before logging in .
after they connect the app , they ’re prompted to use the app to verify their identity .
community members with the high assurance  profile requirement are prompted to connect an authenticator app during login .
example :  you ’ve configured facebook and linkedin as authentication providers in your org .
many of your users use “ social sign - on ” to log in using the username and password for their facebook or linkedin accounts .
you want to increase security by requiring users with the standard user profile to use two - factor authentication when they log in with their facebook account , but not with their linkedin account .
you edit the standard user profile and set the session security level required at login  to high assurance .
in your org ’s session settings , you edit the session security levels . you place facebook in the standard column .
in the high assurance column , you place two - factor authentication .
you also place device activation in the high assurance column , so standard user profile users who activate a device at login are n’t challenged to verify their identity a second time .
finally , you place linkedin in the high assurance column , too .
note :  you can also use login flows to change the user ’s session security level to initiate identity verification under specific conditions .
login flows let you build a custom post - authentication process that meets your business requirements .

see also : knowledge article : salesforce pci attestation of compliance access encrypted data via lightning connect when you link two salesforce organizations together with lightning connect , the subscriber org 's users can now access data that 's encrypted at rest on the provider org and view that data in plaintext .
a user 's access to encrypted data on the subscriber org is determined by the credentials lightning connect uses to connect that user to the provider org .
which credentials are used is determined by the identity type of the external data source definition on the subscriber org .
those credentials are associated with a specific user on the provider org .
if that user on the provider org has the " view encrypted data " permission , users on the subscriber org who are connected with those credentials can view encrypted data on the provider org .
for example , suppose the salesforce admin for the provider org has encrypted the account name field . •
if the subscriber org user is connected via lightning connect as a provider org user with the " view encrypted data " permission , they see the account name field contents as plaintext . •
if the subscriber org user is connected via lightning connect as a provider org user without the " view encrypted data " permission , the account name field contents are masked ( that is , the values are replaced with asterisks ) .

salesforce spring ’16 release notes platform encryption do n't encrypt data with email plugins
safeguards are in place to make sure you deactivate salesforce for outlook , salesforce app for outlook , or exchange sync before encrypting fields or files .
if exchange sync or salesforce app for outlook is active , the validation check prevents platform encryption from activating .
if salesforce for outlook is activated , platform encryption can be activated , but salesforce for outlook stops working .
conversely , if platform encryption is activated , none of the three plugins works .

salesforce help : automatic validation for platform encryption access encrypted data with heroku connect heroku connect supports platform encryption when you use api version 35.0 or higher .
if you are using platform encryption , select api version winter ' 16 v35.0 or higher .
version 35 supports retrieval of objects with platform encryption enabled .
previous api versions do not .
heroku connect typically requires view all data permission , and it may also be necessary to grant modify all data permission when dealing with relationships between objects .
both the user and the salesforce organization also need to have api enabled permission .

how heroku connect works detect field encryption with sobject you can use the sobject describe call to retrieve a field 's encryption status in an organization where the platform encryption license has not been provisioned .
this may simplify package management by enabling you to develop a single package for both pe and non - pe orgs .
for example , if a field is not encrypted , your package can run a soql / where or order by operation , but if it is encrypted , you might run a sosl / find query instead .
encryption is said to be set for a field when encryption is on for both the organization and the field .
when that is the case , sobject describe returns encrypted="true ” .
if encryption is on for either the organization or the field , it returns encrypted=“false ” .

keep in mind that if you encrypt the same fields that you filter in salesforce for outlook data sets , salesforce for outlook wo n’t sync at all .
but it ’s easy to get salesforce for outlook to sync again .
just remove the encrypted fields from your filters in your data sets .
platform encryption supports marketing cloud connect users with with the " view encrypted data " permission can now use marketing cloud connect . 379 salesforce spring ’16 release notes transaction security policies address security issues marketing cloud connect connects the digital marketing capabilities of the salesforce marketing cloud with the data management , segmentation and campaign management tools in salesforce .
now marketing cloud connect users with the " view encrypted data " permission can see data in fields that are encrypted in salesforce .
encrypted data is stored in the marketing cloud in the format that the running user sees that data in the sales or service cloud .
see also : marketing cloud connect encryption encrypt your knowledge articles knowledge articles are a great way to share information with your customers and colleagues .
now you can share encrypted data through your knowledge base by attaching encrypted files to knowledge articles .
to attach encrypted files to a knowledge article , use an article type with a file field .
you can then upload encrypted files as long as you have platform encryption enabled .
transaction security policies address security issues transaction security is a framework that intercepts real - time salesforce events and applies appropriate actions and notifications based on security policies you create .
transaction security monitors events according to the policies that you set up .
these policies are applied against events in your org and specify actions to take when certain event combinations occur .
when a policy is triggered , you can have an action taken and receive an optional notification .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
note :  customers are required to purchase salesforce shield or salesforce shield event monitoring add - on subscriptions to use this feature .
for pricing details , contact your salesforce account executive .
the real - time actions that can be taken are : • notify a salesforce admin that the policy was triggered • block the operation • require the use of two - factor authentication • require the end of a current login session user permissions to create , edit , and manage transaction security policies : • “ author apex ” and “ customize application ”
editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions .
transaction security includes predefined policies to limit concurrent login sessions and to block excessive data downloads done through apis .
both example policies come with a corresponding apex implementation class .
an administrator can edit the apex classes and enable the policies immediately .
for example , you modify the concurrent sessions limiting policy to notify you via email when the policy is triggered .
you also update the policy ’s apex implementation to limit users to three sessions instead of the default five sessions .
( that ’s easier than it may sound . )
later , a user with three login sessions tries to create a fourth .
the policy requires the user to end one of the existing sessions before starting the new session .
at the same time , you are notified that the policy was triggered . 380 salesforce spring ’16 release notes transaction security policies address security issues here ’s another example , showing the user interface and how to create a policy to block use of a specific browser .
in this example we ’ve asked transaction security to generate the policy code .
here ’s the generated code with some added comments : global class blockaccessbybrowserpolicycondition implements txnsecurity .
policycondition { public boolean evaluate(txnsecurity .
event e ) { //
we get the login history from the event , and then the browser from the login history .
loginhistory eobj = [ select browser from loginhistory where i d = : e.data.get('loginhistoryid ' ) ] ; if(eobj .
browser = = ' navigator ' ) { //
navigator is the browser we ’re blocking .
return true ; } return false ; 381 salesforce spring ’16 release notes platform security } } you can modify the generated apex to perform additional tasks , such as block when there ’s a specific platform and browser combination .
here ’s the modified code , again with comments added : global class blockaccessbybrowserpolicycondition implements txnsecurity .
policycondition { public boolean evaluate(txnsecurity .
event e ) { if ( event.resourcetype = = ' loginhistory ' ) { //
let 's make sure we have a login event . //
we still get the login history from the event ... loginhistory eobj = [ select platform , browser from loginhistory where i d = : e.data.get('loginhistoryid ' ) ] ; string platform = eobj .
platform ; //
we retrieve the platform string browser = eobj .
browser ; // as well as the browser .
if ( platform = = ' mac osx ' & & browser.startswith('navigator ' ) ) { return true ; //
now we 're blocking navigator on mac osx . } } return false ; } } along with all the apex features , you can also use external web services when implementing policies .
this ability gives you great flexibility without having to write extra code .
and in case there ’s a conflict in policy actions , transaction security resolves actions with the same event type in the following order : the block action is taken before two - factor authentication , and both of those actions are taken before ending a session .
many other examples are available in the online help .
the following is a partial list . •
requiring high - assurance login sessions when accessing confidential data • blocking access from specific locations or ip addresses • limiting the posting rate on chatter • restricting platform and browser access to specific types • blocking users with vulnerable or outdated systems see also : salesforce help : about transaction security policies salesforce help : apex policies for transaction security notifications platform security you can use the new health check tool to identify and fix security risks in your password , session , and network access settings , all at a glance . 382 salesforce spring ’16 release notes platform security in

in the previous release , we provided this enhancement only for deployments started with the metadata api or api - based tools , such as the force.com migration tool .
in this release , we ’re providing the test resumption enhancement also for change sets .
note : • salesforce saves the results of executed tests in chunks .
therefore , a small portion of tests might not have their results saved because they were n’t part of the last saved chunk .
these tests are rerun when the deployment is restarted . •
if the deployment interruption happens before tests have started , the entire deployment restarts from the beginning .
tip :  salesforce performs major service upgrades three times a year , and minor maintenance updates throughout the year .
long deployments that take several hours to complete are more likely to hit a service update window than shorter deployments .
even 386 salesforce spring ’16 release notes enhanced security with the force.com migration tool though test resumption in restarted deployments can save you time , we recommend that your deployments run as efficiently as possible to lower the chance of interrupted deployments .

new and changed apex classes , enumerations , exceptions , and interfaces these classes , methods , constants , enumerations , exceptions , and interfaces are new or have changed .
connectapi ( chatter in apex ) chatter in apex includes new and changed apex classes , input classes , output classes , and enums .
create more robust apex tests and more flexible test runs we ’ve made lots of improvements to apex tests and the ways you can run them .
in
this section : create test suites of commonly used apex test classes you probably have sets of apex test classes that you regularly run together .
for example , perhaps you have test classes that you run every time you prepare for a deployment or salesforce releases a new version .
you can now create test suites that contain those sets of classes .
rather than selecting all the relevant classes each time you start a test run , you can simply run one or more test suites .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
stop a test run that ’s failing miserably large runs of apex tests sometimes take longer than we ’d like them to .
waiting for a run to finish only to learn that many of your tests failed can be irritating .
you can now configure test runs to stop executing new tests after a given number of tests fail .
you no longer need to waste your time waiting for the results of a run that you ’re going to rerun after fixing issues in your org .
you can set how many tests can fail in test runs that you execute both in the developer console and using the tooling api .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
set and modify the createddate field in apex tests in response to your ideaexchange request , we ’ve added the system .
test.setcreateddate  method .
this method sets a datetime value for a test - context sobject ’s createddate field .
call test.starttest ( ) to reliably reset limits in apex tests a block of test code enclosed by the test.starttest ( )  and test.stoptest ( ) methods now reliably receives its own block of governor limits .
test.starttest ( )  stores your per - transaction limit counters and temporarily resets them to zero .
test.stoptest ( )  restores your limit counters to pre - test.starttest ( )  values .
when your test method finishes , all per - transaction limits reset to zero .
previously , some limits , such as for soql queries , did n’t always reset inside a test.starttest()/test.stoptest ( )  block .
use @future to avoid the dreaded mixed_dml_operation error in apex tests mixed data manipulation language ( dml ) operations within a single transaction are n’t allowed .
you ca n’t perform dml on a setup sobject and a non - setup sobject in the same transaction .
instead , you can perform one type of dml as part of an asynchronous job and run the other types in other asynchronous jobs or in the original transaction .
this alternative is widely used .
however , when this alternative was used within the context of an apex test , errors still resulted .
we ’ve fixed this bug .
compare currency to decimals in apex tests we ’ve fixed a bug that caused an exception to be thrown when comparing a currency value to a decimal value in an apex test .
you can now use data silos that contain both currency values and decimal values and compare these data types to your heart ’s content .
394 salesforce spring ’16 release notes apex code test wsdl - based asynchronous callouts
previously , you could test synchronous wsdl - based callouts , or you could test asynchronous non - wsdl - based callouts .
but testing asynchronous callouts made from an imported wsdl caused your tests to fail with an internal salesforce error .
we ’ve fixed this bug .
create test suites of commonly used apex test classes you probably have sets of apex test classes that you regularly run together .
for example , perhaps you have test classes that you run every time you prepare for a deployment or salesforce releases a new version .
you can now create test suites that contain those sets of classes .
rather than selecting all the relevant classes each time you start a test run , you can simply run one or more test suites .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
create and run test suites in the developer console to create a test suite using the developer console , select test > new suite .
to choose which classes are in a test suite , select test > suite manager >
your test suite > edit suite .
you can create or modify test suites that contain up to 200 test classes using the developer console .
to run one or more test suites’ member classes from the developer console , select test > new suite run .
create and run test suites in the api
each test suite is represented in the soap , rest , and tooling apis by an apextestsuite object , which has a testsuitename  and an id .
a set of testsuitemembership objects , each of which contains an apextestsuiteid and an apexclassid , determines membership in the test suite .
create one testsuitemembership object for each class that you want to add to each test suite .
to remove a test class from a test suite , delete its testsuitemembership object .
the following soql query returns the membership object that relates this apex class to this test suite .
select i d from testsuitemembership where apexclassid = ' 01pd0000000fhy9iac ' and apextestsuiteid = ' 05fd00000004cdbma2 ' to run test suites using the tooling rest api , post a suiteids  list to the runtestsasynchronous rest resource .
you can post both a suiteids  list and a classids  list to runtestsasynchronous .
however , if you send a tests  array , you ca n’t send suiteids  or classids .
to run test suites using the tooling soap api , pass suite ids to the runtestsasynchronous ( )  soap call .
either a classids or a suiteids  parameter is mandatory for runtestsasynchronous , but only one of the two is required .
to provide only one , specify the other as null .

salesforce spring ’16 release notes apex code stop a test run that ’s failing miserably large runs of apex tests sometimes take longer than we ’d like them to .
waiting for a run to finish only to learn that many of your tests failed can be irritating .
you can now configure test runs to stop executing new tests after a given number of tests fail .
you no longer need to waste your time waiting for the results of a run that you ’re going to rerun after fixing issues in your org .
you can set how many tests can fail in test runs that you execute both in the developer console and using the tooling api .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
choose a test failure threshold to allow all tests in your org to run , either do n’t set a test failure threshold or set the threshold to -1 .
to stop your test run from executing new tests after a given number of tests fail , set the failure threshold to an integer value from 0  to 1,000,000 .
this integer value sets the maximum allowable test failures .
a value of 0  causes the test run to stop if any failure occurs .
a value of 1  causes the test run to stop on the second failure , and so on .
synchronous test runs stop when the failure threshold is exceeded .
however , asynchronous test runs execute tests in parallel , so they take a bit longer to stop .
an asynchronous test run stops after it finishes executing the tests that are in progress when the failure threshold is exceeded .
keep in mind that high values can cause slow performance .
each 1,000 tests that you allow to fail adds about 3 seconds to your test run , not including the time that the tests take to execute .
set allowed test failures in the developer console the developer console ’s test run configuration panes have a new settings button .
to specify how many tests can fail before a test run or test suite run is canceled , click settings , enter a value for number of failures allowed , and then click ok .
this value applies for all test runs that you execute , until you close the developer console or set a new value .
set maxfailedtests using the tooling api you can set a maxfailedtests  value for a tooling api rest resource or soap call .
to use rest , post the optional maxfailedtests parameter to the runtestsasynchronous  resource .
to use soap to limit failed tests in a synchronous test run , send a value for runtestsrequest.maxfailedtests  to the runtests ( )  call .
to use soap to limit failed tests in an asynchronous test run , send a maxfailedtests  value above -1  to the runtestsasynchronous ( )  call .
see also : force.com tooling api : rest resources force.com tooling api : soap calls set and modify the createddate field in apex tests in response to your ideaexchange request , we ’ve added the system .
test.setcreateddate  method .
this method sets a datetime value for a test - context sobject ’s createddate field .
insert your test record before you set its createddate , as shown in this example .
@istest private class setcreateddatetest { static testmethod void testsetcreateddate ( ) { account a = new account(name='myaccount ' ) ; insert a ; test.setcreateddate(a .

include asyncapexjob fields in your query to get information such as the job ’s creation date or details about the apex class to be executed .
to find the position of an asyncapexjob in the flex queue , query jobposition .
for example : select jobposition from flexqueueitem where jobtype = ' batchapex ' and asyncapexjobid = ' 707xx000000dabc ' to find the job at a given position , query asyncapexjobid .
for example : select asyncapexjobid from flexqueueitem where jobtype = ' batchapex ' and jobposition = ' 2 ' 398 salesforce spring ’16 release notes apex code to find all batch jobs in the flex queue , query jobtype .

help : monitoring the apex flex queue test performance gains with platform cache trials you can now request trial cache space to test performance improvements by using platform cache in your applications .
enterprise , unlimited , and performance editions come with some cache , but adding more cache often provides greater performance .
when your trial request is approved , you can allocate capacity to partitions and experiment with using the cache for different scenarios .
testing the cache on a trial basis lets you make an informed decision about whether to purchase cache .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
salesforce usually approves trial cache requests in three days .
when your request is approved , you receive 30 mb of trial cache space ( 10 mb if you have developer edition ) .
if you need more trial cache space , contact salesforce .
note :  you can make up to 10 trial cache requests , and you must wait 90 days between trials .
after you request trial cache , you receive emails at the following intervals .
at activation you can now allocate capacity to partitions and test the trial cache in your org .
three days before expiration before expiration , be sure to reconfigure your partitions to deallocate the added trial space .
at expiration the trial cache is removed from your org .
note :  if you haven’t deallocated enough space , salesforce reduces your partition sizes to remove the granted trial cache space .
you can request trial cache for a developer edition org .
after you sign up for the org , request trial cache from the platform cache partition tool .
isvs who are using developer edition orgs to create managed packages can get 10 mb of trial cache for up to two developer edition orgs .
isvs can contact their salesforce representative to get trial cache in developer edition orgs .

this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
399 salesforce spring ’16 release notes apex code platform cache is available to customers with enterprise edition orgs and above .
the following editions come with some default cache space , but often , adding more cache gives even greater performance enhancements .
• enterprise edition ( 10 mb by default ) • unlimited edition ( 30 mb by default ) • performance edition ( 30 mb by default ) to determine how much cache would be beneficial to your applications , you can request trial cache and try it out in your org .
platform cache can improve performance in the following situations , among many others . •
orgs with a large amount of apex customization • orgs with large numbers of concurrent users • orgs or applications with complex calculations or queries
in addition , isvs can purchase cache for use with the applications they provide to customers .
cache space is sold in 10-mb blocks , with an annual subscription .
to purchase platform cache , contact your salesforce representative .

create custom experiences in salesforce using chatter in apex .
many chatter rest api resource actions are exposed as static methods on apex classes in the connectapi  namespace .
these methods use other connectapi  classes to input and return information .
the connectapi  namespace is referred to as chatter in apex .
408 salesforce spring ’16 release notes apex code in apex , it ’s possible to access some chatter data using soql queries and objects .
however , connectapi  classes expose chatter data in a much simpler way .
data is localized and structured for display .
for example , instead of making many calls to access and assemble a feed , you can do it with a single call .
note :  to integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third - party web applications with chatter and communities , use chatter rest api .

unknown lightning components
the lightning component framework powers lightning experience and salesforce1 .
use the framework to build mobile apps and pages in lightning experience , salesforce1 , salesforce classic , and communities .
enhancements this release are focused on toolkit robustness .
this release also offers early access to new capabilities for deploying lightning components apps in non - salesforce containers , new visual design tools , and more sophisticated label formatting .
use out - of - the - box components or build your own components with javascript , html , css , apex , or any web - enabled code .
the appexchange for components enables you to install components created by salesforce partners or publish your own components .
for more information , refer to the lightning components developer guide .
in
this section : editions available for use in : contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions create lightning components using the ui in enterprise , performance , unlimited , developer editions or a sandbox . run lightning components apps anywhere with lightning out ( beta ) whether it ’s a node.js app running on heroku , a department server inside the firewall , or even sharepoint , build your custom app with force.com and run it wherever your users are .
capture design variables with lightning components tokens ( developer preview ) capture the essential values of your visual design into named tokens . define the token values once and reuse them throughout your lightning components css resources .
tokens make it easy to ensure that your design is consistent , and even easier to update it as your design evolves .
do n’t ignore browser console warnings for access check violations !
in spring ’16 , if you access a resource , such as a component or attribute , that does n’t have an access  system attribute allowing you to access it , you see a warning in your browser console if you ’ve enabled debug mode .
the framework will enforce these access checks more strictly in the summer ’16 release so you should n’t ignore them .
otherwise , your code will break when summer ’16 rolls out .
nobody wants that !
debug lightning components with the salesforce lightning inspector the salesforce lightning inspector is a google chrome devtools extension that helps you debug lightning components and profile component performance .
dynamically populate label parameters with format ( ) the first parameter of format ( ) is a custom label referring to a string that can contain placeholders .
the placeholders are replaced at runtime by the substitution values passed as subsequent parameters .
add as many parameters as you need .
the parameters are numbered and zero - based .
improved performance with secure client - side caching we 've added secure data caching in the browser to improve page reload performance by avoiding additional round trips to the server .
this feature is available in lightning experience only . 420 salesforce spring ’16 release notes lightning components $ a.error ( ) is deprecated we deprecated $ a.error ( )  in favor of the standard javascript error  object that is more widely known to developers .
sfdc javascript global is removed sfdc  is a javascript utility object available in the global scope in salesforce application containers .
it ’s an internal - to - salesforce implementation detail , and its use by customers has never been supported or documented .
it ’s no longer added to lightning - specific containers , and you should remove it from your lightning components code .
resolved errors with apex controllers with list or map parameters in previous releases , if your lightning component called a server - side apex controller method and sent a list or map object as a parameter , it could result in an unsupportedoperationexception  error .
this issue is resolved .
lightning components components help you build apps faster .
use them in your lightning apps or in salesforce1 .
see also : lightning components developer guide run lightning components apps anywhere with lightning out ( beta ) whether it ’s a node.js app running on heroku , a department server inside the firewall , or even sharepoint , build your custom app with force.com and run it wherever your users are .
note :  this release contains a beta version of lightning out , which means it ’s a high quality feature with known limitations .
you can provide feedback and suggestions for lightning out on the ideaexchange .
lightning out is the technology that powers lightning components for visualforce , now available in the “ full strength ” version .
the process for using lightning out outside of visualforce is comparably simple . 1 .
setup and preparation . 2 .
create a reference to a lightning components app that includes dependency information about the components you intend to use .
3 .
create components on the page to build the page ’s functionality .
setup is more involved than with lightning components for visualforce , because lightning out is n’t running inside a salesforce container .
you manually handle services that are provided automatically when running inside salesforce .
for example , your client code needs to explicitly manage authentication and session initialization , either with your own code or using a library such as forcejs .
there ’s also some setup within salesforce to allow access to your lightning components app .
you need to configure the remote site for cors and create a connected app with oauth in salesforce .
this process is the same one that you follow for any for app that connects to salesforce .
for more details and sample code , see the lightning components developer guide .

anywhere / everywhere 421 salesforce spring ’16 release notes lightning components capture design variables with lightning components tokens ( developer preview ) capture the essential values of your visual design into named tokens . define the token values once and reuse them throughout your lightning components css resources .
tokens make it easy to ensure that your design is consistent , and even easier to update it as your design evolves .
to create a tokens bundle for your org ’s namespace , do the following .
in the developer console , select file > new > lightning tokens . 1 . 2 .
name the tokens bundle defaulttokens .
note :  in this developer preview of tokens , you can only create one tokens bundle , and the only allowed bundle name is defaulttokens .
the tokens defined within it are automatically accessible in your lightning components .
you now have an empty tokens bundle , ready to edit .
< aura : tokens > < /aura : tokens >
3 .
an individual token is a name - value pair that you specify using the < aura : token >  component .
add new tokens as child components of the bundle ’s < aura : tokens >  component .
for example : < aura : tokens > < aura : token name="mybodytextfontface " value="'salesforce sans ' , helvetica , arial , sans - serif"/ > < aura : token name="mybodytextfontweight " value="normal"/ > < aura : token name="mybackgroundcolor " value="#f4f6f9"/ > < aura : token name="mydefaultmargin " value="6px"/ > < /aura : tokens > tokens created in your defaulttokens  bundle are automatically available in components in your namespace .
to use a design token , reference it using the token ( )  function and the token name in the css resource of a component bundle .
for example : .this p { font - family : token(mybodytextfontface ) ; font - weight : token(mybodytextfontweight ) ; standard design tokens salesforce exposes a set of “ base ” tokens that you can access in your component style resources .
to add the standard tokens to your org , you extend your org ’s tokens bundle from the base tokens , like so .
< aura : tokens extends="force : base " > < ! -- your own tokens here -- > < /aura : tokens > once added to defaulttokens , you can reference tokens from force : base  just like your own tokens , using the token ( ) function and token name .
for example : .this p { font - family : token(fontfamily ) ; font - weight : token(fontweightregular ) ; } } 422 salesforce spring ’16 release notes lightning components you can mix - and - match your tokens with the standard tokens .
using tokens available from force : base  allows you to mimic the look - and - feel of the salesforce lightning design system ( slds ) in your own custom components .
as the slds evolves , components that use the standard design tokens will evolve along with it .
see the lightning components developer guide for more details , including a list of salesforce standard design tokens currently available .
see also : lightning components developer guide do n’t ignore browser console warnings for access check violations !
in spring ’16 , if you access a resource , such as a component or attribute , that does n’t have an access  system attribute allowing you to access it , you see a warning in your browser console if you ’ve enabled debug mode .
the framework will enforce these access checks more strictly in the summer ’16 release so you should n’t ignore them .
otherwise , your code will break when summer ’16 rolls out .
nobody wants that !
you can control access to your applications , interfaces , components , attributes , and events via the access  system attribute on these tags : • aura : application • aura : interface • aura : component • aura : attribute • aura : event the default value for these resources is access="public " , which means the resources are available only within the same namespace .
this sample component has global access .
< aura : component access="global " > ...
< /aura : component >
for more information about the access  system attribute , see the lightning components developer guide .
fixing access check warnings you can fix any access check warnings using one or more of these techniques . •
add appropriate access  system attributes to the resources that you own .
• remove references in your code to resources that are n’t available .
• ensure that any attribute that you ’re accessing exists and you ’re using the correct case - sensitive spelling .
accessing an undefined attribute or a private attribute triggers the same access violation message because the access context does n’t know whether the attribute is undefined or private .
• use $ a.getcallback ( )  to wrap code that accesses a component outside the normal rerendering lifecycle , such as in a settimeout ( )  or setinterval ( )  call or in an es6 promise . $ a.getcallback ( )  preserves the current execution context and grants the correct access level to the asynchronous code .
otherwise , the framework loses context and allows access only to global resources .
423 salesforce spring ’16 release notes lightning components debug lightning components with the salesforce lightning inspector the salesforce lightning inspector is a google chrome devtools extension that helps you debug lightning components and profile component performance .
debugging can be difficult !
the salesforce lightning inspector gives you more insight into what ’s happening under the covers when you ’re developing lightning components .
• navigate the component tree in your app , inspect components and their associated dom elements .
• identify performance bottlenecks by looking at a graph of component creation time .
• debug server interactions faster by monitoring and modifying responses .
• test the fault tolerance of your app by simulating error conditions or dropped action responses .
• track the sequence of event firing and handling for one or more actions .
the chrome extension adds a lightning tab to the devtools menu .
there are several sub tabs available to inspect different aspects of your app .
for details on use and installation , see the lightning components developer guide .
dynamically populate label parameters with format ( ) the first parameter of format ( ) is a custom label referring to a string that can contain placeholders .
the placeholders are replaced at runtime by the substitution values passed as subsequent parameters .
add as many parameters as you need .
the parameters are numbered and zero - based .
for example , if you have three parameters , they are named { 0 } , { 1 } , and { 2 } , and they are substituted in the order they ’re specified .
let ’s look at a custom label , $ label.c.mylabel , with a value of hello { 0 } and { 1 } , where $ label  is the global value provider that accesses your labels .
this expression in markup dynamically populates the placeholder parameters with the values of the supplied attributes . { !
format($label.c.mylabel , v.attribute1 , v.attribute2 ) } the label is refreshed if one of the attribute values changes .
in javascript , use the equivalent $ a.util.format ( ) method .
424 salesforce spring ’16 release notes lightning components for more information about custom labels , see custom labels .
improved performance with secure client - side caching we 've added secure data caching in the browser to improve page reload performance by avoiding additional round trips to the server .
this feature is available in lightning experience only .
you do n't have to do anything to avail of this performance improvement in lightning experience .
we do n't recommend disabling this setting but if your company ’s policy does n’t allow browser caching even if the data is encrypted , you can disable it . 1 .
from setup , enter session settings  in the quick find  box . 2 .
deselect the enable secure and persistent browser caching to improve performance checkbox .
3 . click save .
$ a.error ( ) is deprecated we deprecated $ a.error ( )  in favor of the standard javascript error  object that is more widely known to developers .
use throw new error("your error message here " )  for unrecoverable errors , such as an error that prevents your app from starting successfully .
the error message is displayed .
sfdc javascript global is removed sfdc  is a javascript utility object available in the global scope in salesforce application containers .
it ’s an internal - to - salesforce implementation detail , and its use by customers has never been supported or documented .
it ’s no longer added to lightning - specific containers , and you should remove it from your lightning components code .
the sole exception is the official force.com canvas api , which is available using the sfdc.canvas  object .
canvas apis as documented in the canvas developer guide remain available and are fully supported .
note :
the sfdc  global remains available in the visualforce container , and visualforce code is unaffected .
if your lightning components are used , for example , within a visualforce page using lightning components for visualforce , they continue to have access to the sfdc  global .
this use is unsupported , and these lightning components might not be portable to other contexts .
if your components must have access to values obtained from the sfdc  global , it ’s a best practice to use javascript in visualforce to obtain those values .
then pass them into the lightning component using attributes or events , rather than accessing them directly within the component .
this technique allows your lightning components to be portable , as these values can be obtained using an appropriate mechanism based on the container .
resolved errors with apex controllers with list or map parameters in previous releases , if your lightning component called a server - side apex controller method and sent a list or map object as a parameter , it could result in an unsupportedoperationexception  error .
this issue is resolved .
we do n’t normally describe items in a release note when the change is merely a defect correction .
but this one could result in some awkward workarounds .
we thought you ’d like to know .
lightning components components help you build apps faster .
use them in your lightning apps or in salesforce1 .
425 salesforce spring ’16 release notes api new components the following component is new .
forcechatter : fullfeed the forcechatter : fullfeed  component is used with lightning out ( beta ) and reserved for future use .
this is a beta component .
you ca n't use forcechatter : fullfeed  inside salesforce1 , lightning experience , or in communities that use lightning - compatible templates .
using forcechatter : fullfeed  in any of these causes duplicate posts because the component handles events in each in different ways .

soql salesforce object query language ( soql ) includes a new query scope , enhanced support for the distance and convertcurrency functions , and improved formatting for number , date , time , and currency fields .
in
this section : query records saved in all users’ private folders with the allprivate query scope use the allprivate query scope to find or delete reports and dashboards saved in all users’ private folders . requires the user permission " manage all private reports and dashboards . "
435 salesforce spring ’16 release notes api distance ( ) support with location - based soql queries the distance  function is now supported with location - based queries .
distance ( )  now works with location and address fields .
you can retrieve a specific distance ( say , of a store from a contact ’s location ) and display it to the user .
aliasing in select convertcurrency ( ) statements the convertcurrency  function now supports aliases .
formatting for number , date , time , and currency fields in select clauses these fields now reflect the appropriate format for the given user locale .
the field format matches what appears in the salesforce classic user interface .
query records saved in all users’ private folders with the allprivate query scope use the allprivate query scope to find or delete reports and dashboards saved in all users’ private folders . requires the user permission " manage all private reports and dashboards . "
for example , this query returns reports saved inside users’ private folders that haven’t been run in more than one year .
select i d from report using scope allprivate where lastrundate <
last_n_days:365 you can also query reports saved inside a specific user ’s private folder . select i d from report using scope allprivate where ownerid = ' 005a0000000bc2defg ' distance ( ) support with location - based soql queries the distance  function is now supported with location - based queries .
distance ( )  now works with location and address fields .
you can retrieve a specific distance ( say , of a store from a contact ’s location ) and display it to the user .
for example : select i d , name , location , distance(location , geolocation(latitude , longitude ) , ' mi ' ) from contact ; aliasing in select convertcurrency ( ) statements the convertcurrency  function now supports aliases .
for example : select i d , convertcurrency(annualrevenue ) convertedcurrency from account formatting for number , date , time , and currency fields in select clauses these fields now reflect the appropriate format for the given user locale .
the field format matches what appears in the salesforce classic user interface .
this example is for a multi - currency org : select format(amount ) amt , format(lastmodifieddate ) editdate from opportunity editdate = " 7/2/2015 3:11 am " amt = " aed 1,500.000000 ( usd 1,000.00 ) " 436 salesforce spring ’16 release notes api the soql format  function also supports aliasing .
you can nest it with aggregate or convertcurrency ( )  functions .
for example : select amount , format(amount ) amt , convertcurrency(amount ) editdate , format(convertcurrency(amount ) ) convertedcurrency from opportunity where i d = ' 12345 ' select format(min(closedate ) ) amt from opportunity rest api rest api includes new resources and an intuitive way to construct rest requests .
make the same requests using fewer api calls with friendly urls why make two api calls when you can make just one ?
a friendly url provides an intuitive way to construct rest api requests and minimizes the number of round trips between your app and salesforce org . accessing a contact ’s parent account without a friendly url involves requesting the contact record using the sobject rows resource .
then you examine the account relationship field to obtain the account id and request the account record with another call to sobject rows .
using a friendly url , you can access the account in a single call directly from the contact ’s path : /services / data / v36.0/sobjects / contact / id / account .
this functionality is exposed via the new sobject relationships resource .
new resource : parameterized search a new , simple restful search using parameters instead of sosl clauses is now generally available .
a variation of this feature was beta in winter ’16 .
uri : /vxx.x / parameterizedsearch/?q = search string new resource : sobject relationships accesses records by traversing object relationships via friendly urls .
you can retrieve , update , or delete the record associated with the traversed relationship field .
if there are multiple related records , you can retrieve the complete set of associated records .
uri : /vxx.x / sobjects / sobject / id / relationship field name soap api soap api includes three changed calls .
changed calls these calls have changed in api version 36.0 .
describesobjects ( )  and describesobjectresult the formfactor  field has been added .
this field represents the environment to which the action override applies .
for example , a large  value in this field represents the lightning experience desktop environment , and is valid only for lightning pages .
the networkscopefieldname property has been added .
this property specifies the api name of the networkscopefield that scopes the entity to a community .
for most entities , the value of this property is null . performquickactions ( )  and performquickactionresult the successmessage  field has been added .
this field returns the message that displays to the user upon successful completion of the action .
437 salesforce spring ’16 release notes api runtests ( )  and runtestsrequest the maxfailedtests  field has been added .
this field is an optional parameter for the tooling soap api call runtests ( ) .
to allow all tests in a run to execute , set maxfailedtests  to -1  or do n’t specify a value .
to stop the test run from executing new tests after a given number of tests fail , set maxfailedtests  to an integer value from 0  to 1,000,000 .
this integer value sets the maximum allowable test failures .
a value of 0  causes the test run to stop if any failure occurs .
a value of 1  causes the test run to stop on the second failure , and so on .
chatter rest api chatter rest api includes new and changed resources , request bodies , and response bodies .
integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third - party web applications with salesforce using chatter rest api .

json support for bulk api to make loading and querying large amounts of data easier , bulk api now supports json for requests , responses , and payloads .
streaming api streaming api includes a new feature , durable generic streaming , and a beta feature , durable pushtopic streaming , in version 36.0 .
in
this section : replay generic streaming events ( generally available ) you no longer have to worry about missed generic streaming events when subscribers are disconnected .
you can now retrieve and replay past events with durable generic streaming !
salesforce stores events for 24 hours and allows you to retrieve stored and new events .
subscribers can choose which events to receive by using replay options .
replay pushtopic streaming events ( beta ) you can now replay pushtopic - based streaming events ! salesforce stores events for 24 hours and allows you to retrieve stored and new events .
subscribers can choose which events to receive by using replay options .
replay generic streaming events ( generally available ) you no longer have to worry about missed generic streaming events when subscribers are disconnected .
you can now retrieve and replay past events with durable generic streaming !
salesforce stores events for 24 hours and allows you to retrieve stored and new events .
subscribers can choose which events to receive by using replay options .
the subscriber can choose which events to receive , such as all events within the retention window or starting after a particular event .
the default is to receive only the new events sent after subscribing . streaming api uses an event framework that decouples event producers from event consumers .
therefore , a subscriber can retrieve events at any time and is n’t restricted to listen to events at the time they ’re sent .
events outside the 24-hour retention period are discarded .
event numbering each broadcasted event is assigned a numeric id .
ids are incremented sequentially , but they ’re not guaranteed to be contiguous for consecutive events .
for example , the event following the event with id 999 can have an id of 1,025 .
however , each id is guaranteed to be higher than the id of the previous event .
the id is unique for the org and the channel .
the ids of deleted events are n’t reused .
the id is added in the replayid  field of the notification message .
for example , this json message shows the replayid  field in the event object .
{ " clientid":"a1ps4wpe52qytvcvbsko09tapc " , " data " : { " createddate":"2015 - 11 - 13t19:05:28.334z " , " replayid":55 " event " : { } , 454 salesforce spring ’16 release notes api " payload":"this is a message . " } , " channel":" / u / teststreaming " } in api version 36.0 , the time format of the createddate  field value has also changed to make it consistent with the time format used in the salesforce app .
the time portion now ends with the z  suffix instead of + 0000 .
both suffixes denote a utc time zone .
replaying events the following diagram shows a high - level overview of a stream of events and how event consumers can read events by using various replay options .
replay option replay id -1 -2 table 4 : replay options description subscriber receives all events after the event specified by its replayid value .
subscriber receives new events that are broadcast after the client subscribes .
subscriber receives all events , including past events that are within the 24-hour retention window and new events sent after subscription .
to replay events , use the following endpoint .
https://salesforce_instance / cometd / replay/36.0/ the replay mechanism is implemented in a salesforce - provided cometd extension called cometdreplayextension .
register this extension and then call the setreplay ( )  function .
the following example registers the extension in javascript . //
register streaming extension var replayextension = new cometdreplayextension ( ) ; replayextension.setchannel(<streaming channel to subscribe to > ) ; replayextension.setreplay(<event replay option > ) ; cometd.registerextension('myreplayextensionname ' , replayextension ) ; 455 salesforce spring ’16 release notes api note : • the argument passed to setreplay ( )  is one of the replay options listed in replay options . •
the first argument passed to registerextension ( )  is the name of the replay extension in your code .
in the example , it is set to myextensionname , but it can be any string .
you use this name to unregister the extension later on . •
if the setreplay ( )  function is n’t called , or the cometd extension is n’t registered , only new events are sent to the subscriber ( same as the -1 option ) .
after calling the setreplay ( )  function on the extension , the events that the subscriber receives depend on the replay value parameter passed to setreplay ( ) .
higher event limits for durable generic streaming with durable generic streaming , you can send a higher number of events per day than with generic streaming if you ’re using enterprise , performance , or unlimited edition .
the limit for the number of streaming channels remains unchanged .

subscribers can choose which events to receive by using replay options .
note :  durable pushtopic streaming ( beta ) is production quality but has known limitations .
you can provide feedback , suggestions , and questions for this feature in the durable streaming api group in the salesforce success community .
for information on enabling this feature for your org , contact salesforce .
the subscriber can choose which events to receive , such as all events within the retention window or starting after a particular event .
the default is to receive only the new events sent after subscribing . streaming api uses an event framework that decouples event producers from event consumers .
therefore , a subscriber can retrieve events at any time and is n’t restricted to listen to events at the time they ’re sent .
events outside the 24-hour retention period are discarded .
the way pushtopic events are replayed is identical to how generic streaming events are replayed , except for the subscription channel .
the channel for pushtopic events includes the name of the pushtopic .
for example : " channel":" / topic / mytopicname " 456 salesforce spring ’16 release notes api you can subscribe to a pushtopic channel by passing replay options to a cometd extension at the following replay endpoint . https://salesfoce_instance / cometd / replay/36.0/
to learn how to pass options to the replay cometd extension , see the code examples in replay generic streaming events ( generally available ) and the spring ’16 version of the streaming api developer guide .

for more details , see describevaluetype ( ) . runtests ( )  and runtestsasynchronous ( ) you can now pass apextestsuite ids to the runtestsasynchronous ( )  soap call .
you can pass a maxfailedtests  parameter to the runtests ( )  and runtestsasynchronous ( )  soap calls .
the structure of a call to runtests ( ) hasn’t changed , but the runtestsrequest object that it takes now has a maxfailedtests field .
to allow all tests in a run to execute , set maxfailedtests  to -1  or do n’t specify a value .
to stop the test run from executing new tests after a given number of tests fail , set maxfailedtests  to an integer value from 0  to 1,000,000 .
this integer value sets the maximum allowable test failures .
a value of 0  causes the test run to stop if any failure occurs .
a value of 1 causes the test run to stop on the second failure , and so on .
rest resource runtestsasynchronous you can now post a suiteids  list to the runtestsasynchronous  rest resource .
you can post both a suiteids  list and a classids  list to runtestsasynchronous .
however , if you send a tests  array , you ca n’t send suiteids  or classids .
you can also post an optional maxfailedtests  parameter .
to allow all tests in your org to run , regardless of how many tests fail , omit maxfailedtests  or set it to -1 .
to stop the test run from executing new tests after a given number of tests fail , set maxfailedtests  to an integer value from 0  to 1,000,000.this integer value sets the maximum allowable test failures .

a value of 1  causes the test run to stop on the second failure , and so on .
keep in mind that high values can cause slow performance .
each 1,000 tests that you add to your maxfailedtests  value add about 3 seconds to your test run , not including the time that the tests take to execute .

duplicate management turned on for new orgs maintaining high - quality data is one of the most important things you can do to help your organization get the most out of salesforce .
so we ’re excited to announce that all new salesforce orgs now come with duplicate record management features turned on for accounts , contacts , and leads .
now it ’s easier than ever to prevent duplicate records in your org .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
important :  duplicate management uses data.com technology .
however , a data.com license is not required to use this feature .
editions available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions new orgs come with standard account , contact , and lead duplicate rules , which define what happens when you try to save a duplicate record .
each standard duplicate rule has a corresponding matching rule that determines how two records are identified as duplicates .
no setup is required for new orgs , but you can always turn off these rules at any time or create custom rules .
if you try to add a duplicate record , the standard duplicate rules are set to show an alert .
as part of duplicate management , you can easily create a custom report type to review duplicate records that were added .
for more information about data.com duplicate management , including detailed information about duplicate and matching rules , see managing duplicate records in salesforce .
you can also check out this video :  managing duplicate records in salesforce with duplicate rules .
474 salesforce spring ’16 release notes edition name in lightning experience edition name in lightning experience your salesforce organization edition can now be found on the company information page in lightning experience .
in salesforce classic the edition is still shown in the browser tab and the company profile page .
editions available in all editions you can check your edition on the company information page . 1 .
from setup , enter company information  in the quick find  box , then select company information . 2 .
organization edition appears in the lower right .
change owners for more types of records in lightning experience your users can now change record owners for work orders and campaigns , and assign some records , like leads , cases , work orders , and custom objects , to queues in lightning experience .
editions edit inline in lightning experience reps can now edit individual fields on a record details tab and easily edit multiple fields at one time .
what ’s more : users are warned if they try to navigate away before saving a record .
no more lost edits ! inline editing is fast and easy .
when you double - click a field or click the edit icon next to it , the entire record opens in edit mode .
reps can breeze through the record and update several fields at once .
it ’s more tedious in salesforce classic — you have to double - click each field to open it for editing .
available in : contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions editions available in : group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions 475 salesforce spring ’16 release notes email templates and letterheads no longer support scripts here are a few more advantages to inline editing in lightning experience .
• reps can navigate within the page while editing a record .
they can switch to the record ’s chatter feed and back without losing changes .
• reps are warned if they try to navigate to another page or browser tab without saving changes .
no more redoing edits when they close the browser tab or browser by mistake . •
error messages are more compact and easily accessible .
instead of appearing at the top of the form , error messages appear in a window at the bottom .
reps can click to hide the window when scrolling through a long record .
note :  inline editing is automatically enabled in lightning experience by default .
this permission can cause any visualforce objects , formula fields , and summary roll - up fields you ’ve created to appear on the create , edit , or clone pages .
if you see these fields on these pages but haven’t configured them to work on these pages , contact salesforce for help disabling the “ sfx inline edit ”
permission .
you can then edit your record by clicking the edit button .
note :  right now , inline editing works only when editing record details .
soon , it ’ll be available in the highlights panel and list views .
email templates and letterheads no longer support scripts
to protect email recipients from potentially dangerous html content , salesforce now applies a filter to prevent any active scripts from being included in letterheads and email templates .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only . 476 salesforce spring ’16 release notes critical updates critical updates this release includes updates that improve the performance , logic , and usability of salesforce but might affect your existing customizations .

at salesforce , we continually work on existing documentation to improve its usefulness .
in this release , we adjusted the salesforce limits documentation , and we will continue to do so over the next few releases .
we based our changes on the following goals .
• reduce documentation volume and redundancy . • distinguish limits from limitations .
478 salesforce spring ’16 release notes walkthroughs limits measurement information based on a key aspect of a feature .
limits regulate the use of a feature , and are usually numeric .
limitations information about features users might expect .
limitations are often things a user needs to consider before doing something . •
add cross - references in the salesforce limits documentation to salesforce help topics about related features , including procedural topics and topics that address limitations and considerations . •
improve the visual presentation of limits for easier comprehension .
walkthroughs a walkthrough is a series of interactive steps that guides you through a task or feature .
we created some walkthroughs to introduce you to different features in salesforce , and more are on their way !
before you start a walkthrough , make sure you have the correct user permissions and license associated with the feature so you can access the proper pages in salesforce .

important :  keep in mind that walkthroughs guide you through your own salesforce account , so you ’re actually making changes to the data in your organization as you walk through the steps .

feature walkthroughs you ’ll need ... report on file search activity walk through it : report on file search activity “ run reports ” and “ view
