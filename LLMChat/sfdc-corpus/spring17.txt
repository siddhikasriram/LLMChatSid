use console apps to give your users a productivity boost , allowing them to edit and reference multiple records at once .
when a user chooses a record from a related list , it opens as a tab in the console .
when a user opens a related record , it opens as a subtab .
console apps remember tabs , so that when a user navigates away from the page , they do n’t lose any time when they come back .
console apps in lightning experience have much of the same console functionality that you ’re used to with salesforce classic , such as the three - column layout and pinned tabs , but updated with the styling of lightning experience .
you can also customize lightning console apps with lightning pages and components , thanks to the flexibility of the lightning platform .
for sales and service , we ’re providing out - of - the - box console apps .
these apps are located in the app launcher under sales console and service console .
you can also create your own console apps in lightning experience .
to create a console app or customize one of ours , from setup enter app in the quick find  box and select app manager .
from the app manager , you can edit the salesforce - provided console apps or create your own with the new lightning app wizard .

in the wizard , you can customize an application ’s color and branding , add components to its utility bar , choose which items to appear , and decide which users have access .
once you ’ve saved a console app , you ca n’t edit it to use standard navigation .
note :  lightning console apps do n’t yet have full parity with salesforce classic console apps .
for example , some features in salesforce classic console apps , such as keyboard shortcuts and macros , are n’t available in lightning console apps .

after your app is saved , console users can see their history for subtabs in context of the workspace tabs they ’ve visited ( 1 ) and copy links in one click ( 2 ) .
if a tab name is updated , like when a user updates a contact ’s name , the history list is updated , too .
note :  you can use the history utility only in lightning console apps , not in lightning apps with standard navigation .
you ca n’t change the history properties , such as the label and icon .
keep these things in mind when working with the utility . •
the list can display up to 10 primary tabs at a time , with 10 subtabs under each primary tab .
• workspace tabs are listed in the order last visited , with the most recent at the top .
subtabs are listed under their workspace tabs in the order first opened . •
if you copy a subtab link , the record opens as a workspace tab . •
if you copy a link and want to share it with other users , make sure that they are logged in to salesforce before opening the link .
otherwise , the link directs them to the home page instead of the specific record .

account hierarchy
in lightning experience , you can choose the parent account to retain .
in salesforce classic , the merged account retains the account hierarchy from the master record .
no support for merging person accounts in lightning experience lightning experience does n’t support merging of person accounts .
primary account
in lightning experience , you can merge contacts that have different primary accounts unless the contact is associated with a portal user .
in salesforce classic , you can merge only contacts that have the same primary account .
the primary account is the account listed in the account name  field on the contact record . 114 salesforce spring release notes redundant relationships core sales features :
sales guidance , orders , and other features if you try to merge contacts that are indirectly related to the same account , salesforce displays a message suggesting that you remove the redundant relationship .
on contact records , indirect relationships are managed from the related accounts related list .
portal users when you use lightning experience to merge contacts associated with portal users , the portal user status is n’t shown during merging .
the merged record retains the portal user status of the master record .
when you use salesforce classic to merge contacts associated with portal users , the portal user status is shown during merging .
you choose the portal status you want to retain in the merged record .
in both lightning experience and salesforce classic , the master contact must be associated with a portal user .
the merged contact retains the portal user status of the master contact .
if a non - master contact is associated with a portal user , that user is deactivated .
related items , chatter feeds , and attachments when duplicate records are related to items such as campaigns or activities , salesforce relates the items to the merged record , with some exceptions .
chatter feeds are retained from the master record only .
attachments in chatter feeds are retained in salesforce but are n’t associated with the merged record .
to associate the dropped files with the merged record , find them in files home ( in lightning experience ) or the files tab ( in salesforce classic ) .
then add them to the files related list on the merged record .

fields that are n’t listed in the einstein component still influence the score , but less than the fields listed .
the einstein component also lets reps send an email to the lead and , if you have lightning voice set up , call the lead .
when you or your users add the score field to list views , hovering over a score ( 1 ) displays the insights ( 2 ) behind the score .
when sales reps focus on leads with higher scores , they ’re likely to convert more of them to opportunities .
the lock ( 3 ) indicates that the score is read - only .

a mapping describes the relationship between lists of data service fields and fields on your records ( in this case , accounts ) .
the mapping consists of pairs of fields .
each pair has one field on data service records ( 5 ) and one field on account records ( 6 ) .
for example , the data service field city is paired with the account field billing city .
notice that you ca n’t change the data service field , but you can change the account field .

173 salesforce spring release notes customize field mapping for data integration rules update the update mapping controls what data is copied from the data service record to your record .
each field in the data service record updates its paired field in your record .
in the example , data.com provides data in the city field .
during the update , the value of city is copied to the billing city field in the matched account record .
if you choose the shipping city account field , the update copies city to shipping city .
the list of data service fields includes fields for all the data that the service offers for your records .
you ca n’t change the data service fields , but you can change the record fields .
if a data service offers data for different objects , the data service fields column lists a different set of fields for each object .
for example , a data service that updates both accounts and leads can have one field list for accounts and a different one for leads .
considerations the match field list and the update field list for a data integration rule can contain different fields .
for example , the data service can match your records based on company name and location , and then update your records with financial data .
the data service copies data only when : • the field value in your record is blank or null . •
the field types of the data service field and your record ’s field are compatible . •
the scale and precision of the data service field and your record ’s field are compatible .

& — denotes a new parameter in the url .
if no other parameters are present in the url , then substitute ?  in place of & . •
fv0 — the fv stands for " filter value , " and is the name of the parameter .
the 0  is the numerical order in which the filter appears in the report .
( the first filter is 0 , the second filter is 1 , the third is 2 , and so forth . )

what is a dataset recipe ?
a dataset recipe is a saved set of transformations , or steps , to perform on a specific source dataset or replication .
when you run a recipe , it applies the transformations and outputs the results to a new target dataset .
you can schedule a recipe to run on a recurring basis to keep your target dataset up to date .
use a recipe to combine data from different sources , and modify field values to ensure consistency in the new dataset you create .
you can use the new dataset as a standalone dataset for exploration or dashboard creation , or in your dataflows or other recipes .
create a dataset recipe you create , run , schedule , and manage your recipes all in one place — the data manager .
231 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights head to the prepare tab of the data manager , where you can access your existing recipes and datasets .
go to any dataset or replication in the data manager to create a recipe for it , or click create recipe to select your source data and get started .
all your data preparation takes place on a single dataset recipe page , so all the tools you need are close at hand .
the recipe preview ( 1 ) gives you a real - time preview of your data as you prepare it .
if you ’re feeling overwhelmed by too many fields or rows , click the above the preview to change what you see .
as you work on your data , your changes appear as recipe steps in the left pane ( 2 ) .
when you ca n’t find a field , use the field navigator in the right pane ( 3 ) to search for a field .
if you see a field that you do n’t need in your preview , click the page . to hide it .
you can toggle the field navigator on and off with the button at the top of the note :  the recipe preview displays up to 100 fields .
modify the preview or hide fields to ensure that you can see just the fields you are preparing .
when you later create the dataset , you can select all the fields you want for the new dataset .
232 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights prepare the data your data preparation tools are all there for you at the top of the recipe page : let ’s say you have a us leads dataset that you are preparing for use in a marketing dashboard .
here ’s what you can do .
add fields from a lookup dataset or replication .
using a merge key field to match rows in your recipe with rows in your lookup , select the lookup fields you want to bring into your recipe .
for example , join a geodata dataset to your leads dataset using the zip code as a merge key .
then select the geodata fields .
note :  you can add fields from up to 10 datasets or replications .
the lookup dataset preview can display up to 100 fields .
modify the preview or hide fields to ensure that you can see just the fields that you need .

filter the rows in your recipe .
for example , filter out leads that have a po box zip code .
233 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights add a field to bucket values from a specified dimension or measure field .
for example , add a field to categorize leads according to the number of people in the household .
add a formula field to calculate new values from measures in your recipe using arithmetic operators and math functions .
for example , calculate how the household size for each lead compares to the national average .
transform values in a specified dimension field .
you can change case , split values using a delimiter , truncate values , or replace values with new ones .
for example , change category values to match the values that marketing uses .
navigate your changes as you prepare your data , each change you make appears as a recipe step on the left . do n’t worry if you do n’t get it right the first time .
you can revisit each step to make changes .
234 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights hover and click to see options .
go to takes you back and forward to see your data at different steps .
edit lets you make changes .
make changes to formula fields and transformations inline !
note :  a recipe can have up to 100 recipe steps .
create the dataset you can save the recipe at any time to come back to it later .
when the recipe is complete , click create dataset .
note :  a recipe run counts toward your limit of 24 dataflow runs per day .
for example , in an org using the sales wave app , a user dataflow , and two recipes , there are four separate dataflows .
if you schedule each one to run every six hours , you reach the daily limit .
consider this limit when you schedule a recipe .
get better results with null measure handling wave now supports null values in measures , instead of replacing nulls with zeros .
good news for all your calculated averages and minimum values !
learn more about how this feature works and what you need to consider before you turn it on .
why is null measure handling important ?
when you create or update a dataset , through your dataflow or a csv upload for example , any blank measure values in your data need to be replaced with concrete values .
wave uses the default values specified in your dataflow or csv metadata file to replace blank values .
previously , this default had to be a numeric value , usually 0 , and when no default value was set , wave used 0 .
however , replacing blank values with zeros can be problematic for a number of reasons .
consider this example of data with customer satisfaction scores , where some customers have not responded .
235 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights source data dataset with zeros for blanks calculated values such as average and minimum are correct in the source data , but when blank values are replaced with zeros when the dataset is created , the resulting calculations are incorrect .
here the zeros are included in the calculation .
enabling null measure handling lets you specify defaults using the special “ null ” value in your dataflows and csv metadata files .
when no default value is specified , wave replaces blanks with null values .
when you create the customer csat dataset using null measures , the average and minimum calculations are correct .
source data dataset with nulls for blanks enable null measure handling null measure handling is enabled in orgs created after the spring ‘ 17 release and can not be disabled .
when you enable null measure handling in an existing org , you must take additional steps to ensure that the upgrade goes smoothly .
if you choose to enable the feature , you ca n’t disable it .
for this reason , first contact salesforce customer support to evaluate your org .
additional steps are necessary in existing orgs because null measure handling ca n’t retroactively change zeros to nulls , if those zeros have previously replaced blank values .
this behavior can result in datasets containing a mixture of zeros coming explicitly from the source data , zeros replacing blank values , and nulls .
aggregate calculations in such datasets continue to be incorrect .
let ’s look at example opportunity data extracted incrementally before null measure handling is enabled .
again , aggregate calculations are not accurate .
236 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights source data dataset with zeros for blanks , null measure handling is off if you enable null measure handling and run an incremental extract that includes a new opportunity with a blank amount , the blank is now replaced with a null .
however , aggregate calculations are still not accurate because of the mixture of zero replacements and nulls .
source data dataset with zeros and nulls for blanks , null measure
handling is on for this reason , it is important to take these steps , after enabling null measure handling . 1 .
update your existing dataflow definition files to use null instead of 0 in defaultvalue  attributes for measure fields . 2 .
create new instances of long - lived datasets used as a source for dataflows , using a defaultvalue  of null for measure fields .
long - lived datasets are typically reference datasets that are not updated through a dataflow and used to augment data in other datasets .
for example , you might use a geolocation dataset to augment lead information based on zip codes .
3 .
if you have incrementally built datasets in which the source data is no longer available , use a custom dataflow to manually convert 0 values to null .
incrementally built datasets are datasets that are created over time by appending rows , such as logs .
in addition , reimplement delta  transformations in your dataflows using the computerelative  transformation .
the delta transformation is not supported when null measure handling is enabled , and dataflows containing delta transformations fail .
important :  if you are considering enabling null measure handling , read enable null measure handling for more information about the steps to take .
when salesforce makes null measure handling available in your org , you can enable it from setup .
enter wave analytics in the quick find box , then click settings .
select enable null measure handling in wave analytics , and then click save .
237 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights how null measure handling changes the behavior of dataflow transformations when you enable null measure handling , your existing dataflows and csv uploads continue to work .
however , consider these behavior changes .
append augment computeexpression computerelative wave can append datasets with different measure fields .
for example , if one dataset has an amount field that is not present in a second dataset , the new dataset created after the append has an amount field containing nulls in rows from the second dataset .
without null measure handling , appending datasets is not possible when measure fields are different .
when the key in the left dataset is null or has no match in the right dataset , wave appends columns from the right dataset and inserts nulls for dimensions and measures .
without null measure handling , wave inserts zeros for measures .
the defaultvalue  attribute for a computed field accepts a value of null .
for example : " saqlnode " : { " action " : " computeexpression " , " parameters " : { " source " : " extractopp " , " mergewithsource " : true , " computedfields " : [ { } " name " : " amount2 " , " type " : " numeric " , " precision " : 18 , " defaultvalue " : " null " , " scale " : 5 , " saqlexpression " : " amount+amount " the defaultvalue  attribute for a computed field accepts a value of null .
when a value ca n’t be calculated , such as when previous ( )  or next()has no value , wave uses this default .
for example : " computetrending " : { " action " : " computerelative " , " parameters " : { " partitionby " : [ " opportunityid " ] , " orderby " : [ " name":"createddate " , " direction":"asc " ] , " computedfields " : [ " name " : " amountprev " , " defaultvalue " : " null " , " expression " : { " sourcefield " : " amount " , " offset " : " previous ( ) " , " default " : " null " { } { } } 238 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights delta dim2mea sfdcdigest this transformation is not supported when null measure handling is enabled and dataflows containing delta transformations fail .
reimplement delta transformations in your dataflows using the computerelative transformation ( see enable null measure handling ) .
the measuredefault  parameter accepts a value of null .
wave uses this value when it ca n’t convert a dimension to a valid numeric value .
when no default is specified , wave uses a value of null .
for example : " create_measure_from_dimension " : { " action " : " dim2mea " , " parameters " : { " dimension " : " stageval__c " , " measure " : " stagevalue " , " measuredefault " : " null " , " source " : " extract_opportunities " } } the defaultvalue  attribute for a field accepts a value of null .
when no default is specified , wave uses a value of null .
for example : sample sfdc - digest : { " extract_opportunities " : { " action " : " sfdcdigest " , " parameters " : { " object " : " opportunity " , " fields " : [ { } " name " : " amount " , " defaultvalue " : " null " , " precision":18 " scale":2 update wave can update non - null values with nulls .
extended metadata files on dataset edit page
now use xmd 2.0 extended metadata ( xmd ) files added through a dataset edit page now use xmd 2.0 syntax instead of xmd 1.1 , and individual xmd files are now limited to 5 mb .
learn how this affects your existing xmd files , and what you need to do with new files that you upload .
xmd 2.0 uses the same parameters as xmd 1.1 , but it has a different structure where each field has a block of parameters .
in addition , some of these parameters have been renamed , and new parameters have been introduced .
wave converts existing xmd files added through a dataset edit page to the new syntax .
if it ca n’t convert a file , you see an error message when you open the dataset edit page .
whenever you upload a new xmd file , wave validates the syntax and file size , returning an error if either are invalid .
we recommend that you review your existing xmd files on dataset edit pages .
if you see an xmd file with an error , follow these steps to ensure that the file is using the correct syntax . 1 .
download the file from the dataset edit page and create a copy as a backup . 2 .
convert the file syntax to xmd 2.0 .
3 . upload the converted file in the dataset edit page , and check for errors .

and if you use the wave dashboard designer 's query builder to create steps , the new roomier version gives you a better view of the charts or tables you create .
broaden your visualization horizons with new wave charts use radars , trees , and bubbles to visualize your business .
these new charts , along with other new types such as matrix and multi - metric timeline charts , add to your options for visualizing any kind of data .
use radar charts to display a small dataset with one dimension and at least three measure columns .
for example , compare the year 's quarterly numbers for contracts signed , total contract amount , and average contract amount .
248 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights use tree maps to visualize hierarchical quantitative data , where containing rectangles designate relationship with color , and " leaf " rectangles represent quantity using area .
for example , you can show the number of opportunities by city in each state .
like map charts , bubble maps use visual cues to indicate measure values in specified geographical areas .
for example , you can show the relative number of opportunities in each state .
249 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights use matrix charts ( new to wave dashboard designer ) to create a table that represents measures visually , allowing you to quickly spot extreme values .
for example , show which product families are generating the most opportunities .
with multi - metric timeline charts , you can simultaneously compare multiple measures over time , all with one visualization .
for example , you can plot monthly closed opportunities along with total contract value . 250 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights enhanced wave charts from predictive lines to scaled axes , customizable label sizes to better handling of null values , wave charts continue to expand the boundaries of utility and flexibility .
need to drive home the point that your data is looking into the future ?
look no further than adding a predictive line to your timeline chart .
you set the date at which the timeline leaves existing data behind and uses predicted data to chart its course .
speaking of the future , you can now set goals on flat gauges using reference lines .
251 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights improving the readability of your charts is even easier with custom label spacing and a log - style scale for vertical axes .
your finished chart could start out being a bit difficult to read : but with some help from log - like scaling , it can become a star performer : 252 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights control the size of legend text in charts to make it more readable , or keep it out of the way , with the legend sizing menu .
other improvements include allowing screen readers to read all data points in a chart and indicating nulls with hyphens . 253 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights wave : design and build build dashboards more efficiently in wave designer with connected datasets , more powerful filters , bulk actions , and pivot table support .
in
this section : build dashboards faster with widget cloning and step replacement clone widgets to create similar looking components in a wave dashboard .
for example , quickly create three number widgets and swap out their steps to show total open , total won , and total lost opportunity amounts .
you can also clone chart widgets and change the chart type to get a different view of the same results .
automate cross - dataset filtering with connected data sources
by default , steps from the same dataset are faceted — automatically filtering each other .
to facet steps from different datasets or even static steps in a wave designer dashboard , connect them .
previously , you had to modify json and use bindings to facet these steps .
customize the display values for list and toggle widgets you can now configure list and toggle widgets to show values from multiple fields .
for example , a list widget can show sales rep and region , with values like salesrepa - west , salesrepb - west , and salesrepc - north — allowing you to filter on both fields .
you can also display measures as part of the value , and format the display .
take action on multiple table records with a single click you can create custom bulk actions that apply to all records shown in a table widget of a wave designer dashboard .
use bulk actions to update records or perform an action on each of them .
for example , if the table shows patients who haven’t seen their doctor in two years , the bulk action can email each of them a reminder .
summarize data across dimensions with pivot tables you can now display a table widget as a pivot table in a wave designer dashboard .
the widget pivots the table based on the last defined grouping .
the grouping must be defined on a single dimension .
save and package images with wave apps you can now use wave designer to upload images for image widgets and backgrounds .
wave designer saves them to an image gallery associated with the dashboard ’s app .
the maximum file size for an image is 2 gb .
if you package a wave dashboard , wave now includes images .
get accurate calculations with the new null measure handling calculations now ignore null measures .
previously , they were counted as zeroes .
if all values in a calculation are null , the result is also null .
as a result , your widgets might show different results .
a null measure now appears as a dash in the wave designer and explorer .
query datasets and salesforce objects with new step types wave designer dashboards support more step types , which allow you to query salesforce objects and datasets .
experience more intuitive controls for the date widget you can configure the date widget to show fiscal and calendar years as well as the relative and absolute date ranges .
while the dashboard is in preview mode , the date widget offers a more intuitive design for selecting absolute and relative dates .
identify steps with descriptive labels make it easier to work with steps by giving them a descriptive label .
for example , “ won opportunity amount ” is more informative than the default id “ amount_1 . ”
specify the label when you create the step because wave generates the step id based on the label .
after creating the step , you can change the label but not the id , unless you edit the json .
step ids are required when working in the dashboard json , like when defining bindings .
take advantage of other enhancements to wave dashboard designer do more with wave designer .

9 .
click save .
note :  if you previously added a dataset and dimension to a static step definition to facet it with another step , wave creates a data source connection between them .
it also removes the dataset and dimension from the step definition .
customize the display values for list and toggle widgets you can now configure list and toggle widgets to show values from multiple fields .
for example , a list widget can show sales rep and region , with values like salesrepa - west , salesrepb - west , and salesrepc - north — allowing you to filter on both fields .
you can also display measures as part of the value , and format the display .
to customize the display values , click customize display and format in the widget properties .
from the add field ... dropdown , select a grouping or measure defined in the step query .
you can insert more characters directly into the editor box to format the display .
for instance , you can add parentheses to enclose the measure value as shown here .
take action on multiple table records with a single click you can create custom bulk actions that apply to all records shown in a table widget of a wave designer dashboard .
use bulk actions to update records or perform an action on each of them .
for example , if the table shows patients who haven’t seen their doctor in two years , the bulk action can email each of them a reminder .
wave does n’t support bulk actions on table widgets that are built on static  or soql step types .
to add a bulk action to a table widget : 1 .
in a visualforce page , define the logic that the bulk action performs . 2 .
configure the following widget properties to display the bulk action in the table widget ’s action menu .
property show custom action description select to display the bulk action in the widget ’s action menu . 258 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights property custom action label visualforce page name description label for the action in the action menu .
api name of the visualforce page where you defined the logic for the bulk action .
visualforce namespace prefix optional .

the bulk action appears in the action menu of the table widget .
note :  this widget - level action menu is different from the record - level action menu that you can access from a record .
for more information , see “ configure bulk actions on table records . ” summarize data across dimensions with pivot tables you can now display a table widget as a pivot table in a wave designer dashboard .
the widget pivots the table based on the last defined grouping .
the grouping must be defined on a single dimension .
the following table pivots on the priority grouping .
259 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights to display a table widget as a pivot table , select show as pivot table .
” this option appears only if the step query contains a grouping .
save and package images with wave apps you can now use wave designer to upload images for image widgets and backgrounds .
wave designer saves them to an image gallery associated with the dashboard ’s app .
the maximum file size for an image is 2 gb .
if you package a wave dashboard , wave now includes images .
to upload an image , you need the “ create and edit wave analytics dashboards ” and “ create wave analytics apps ” user permissions .
when you need an image , you can upload one or use an existing one from the gallery . 260 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights if you previously added images using the document id , those images continue to work .
the document id is visible , but not editable , in the user interface .
to replace these images , remove them and pick a new image from the image gallery .
get accurate calculations with the new null measure handling calculations now ignore null measures .
previously , they were counted as zeroes .
if all values in a calculation are null , the result is also null .
as a result , your widgets might show different results .
a null measure now appears as a dash in the wave designer and explorer .
null measure handling is enabled in orgs created during or after the spring release — it ca n’t be disabled .
for information about enabling null measure handling in an existing org , see get better results with null measure handling . query datasets and salesforce objects with new step types wave designer dashboards support more step types , which allow you to query salesforce objects and datasets .
you can manually define the following new step types in the dashboard json .
you ca n’t use these step types in compact form .
saql step type use the saql  step type for special cases when querying a wave dataset .
with this step type , you can write a custom saql query to create derived fields in a values table . you can specify dimensions without groupings .
also , you can bind the dataset name or entire query .
for example , you can bind this step type to a static step that provides different saql queries or datasets .
261 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights here ’s an example of the json syntax for a saql step . " oppty2prodsaql " : { " type " : " saql " , " label " : " oppty2prodsaql " , " query " : " q = load \"goppty\ " ; q = group q by i d ; q = foreach q generate i d as ' i d ' , first('account ' ) as ' account ' , sum(oppty_amount ) as ' sum_oppty_amount ' ; " , " isfacet " : true , " useglobal " : true , " selectmode " : " single " } tip :  for the query to return dimensions that are n’t included in groupings , use the first ( ) function .
in the example , because there ’s a unique i d for each opportunity record , the first retrieved account for each id is the right account —
it ’s actually the only account .
if there were duplicate ids for an opportunity , the query would assign the wrong account to all subsequent opportunities after the first one .
property type label query isfacet description step type .
set to saql .
step label .
saql query .
for more information about saql queries , see wave analytics saql reference .
enables this step to facet and be faceted by other steps .
faceting is when a selection in a widget filters other steps in the dashboard .
by default , steps from the same dataset are faceted .
to facet steps from different datasets , connect the data sources .
the autofilter  property is not required to enable faceting for these step types .
useglobal apply global filters to this step .
soql step type use to directly query salesforce objects — both standard and custom — to get salesforce data that ’s not available in datasets .
you can also query external objects created with an odata adapter for salesforce connect .
for more information about using salesforce connect to access external data , see the salesforce connect online help .
the user viewing the dashboard must have access to the object and fields queried by the soql  step .
here ’s an example of the json syntax for a soql step . " soql " : { " type " : " soql " , " query " : " select name from account " , " strings " : [ " name " ] , " numbers " : [ ] , " groups " : [ ] , " selectmode " : " single " } 262 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights property type label query strings description step type .
set to soql .
step label .
soql query .
for more information about soql queries , see force.com soql and sosl reference .
flags the specified fields as non - grouping dimensions .
for example , you can flag a field as a dimension for a values table in which no groupings are allowed . numbers flags the specified fields as measures . groups flags the specified fields as groupings .
for example , you can flag a field as a grouping for a pivot table or chart .
the isfacet  and useglobal  properties do n’t apply to this step type .
you can use a binding to filter other steps based on a selection in a soql  step .
note :  you can also optionally specify the “
strings ” , “ numbers ” , and “ groups ” step properties for static steps .
specify these properties to apply a static step to a widget that requires groupings or measures .
experience more intuitive controls for the date widget you can configure the date widget to show fiscal and calendar years as well as the relative and absolute date ranges .
while the dashboard is in preview mode , the date widget offers a more intuitive design for selecting absolute and relative dates .
263 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights while previewing a dashboard , you can quickly scroll through years and months when selecting an absolute date .
previously , you had to enter the date or use the slider to pick a date .
264 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights in relative date mode , the new , intuitive design allows you to select dates relative today , where today is based on utc .
you can also type in your own values for the range .
identify steps with descriptive labels make it easier to work with steps by giving them a descriptive label .
for example , “ won opportunity amount ” is more informative than the default id “ amount_1 . ”
specify the label when you create the step because wave generates the step id based on the label .
after creating the step , you can change the label but not the id , unless you edit the json .
step ids are required when working in the dashboard json , like when defining bindings .
the label appears when you clip a step , when you create a step from a widget wizard , and , as shown below , in the step panel .
note :  you do n’t get the option to add the step label when you use a widget wizard to create the step for a list , toggle , date , or range widget .
take advantage of other enhancements to wave dashboard designer do more with wave designer .

wave designer contains the following enhancements .
• dashboards created in or after spring are fully packageable .
link widgets and images are now included in packages .
to enable this feature , you can no longer delete assets ( like images , dashboards , lenses ) that other assets reference .
to delete them , you must first remove the reference .
this new behavior applies only to assets that you create from this release onwards .
previously , you could delete referenced assets , which would cause errors in the dashboard .
• control the size of widgets by selecting the “ fine ” row height for the wave designer grid .
when using this option , the vertical spacing is set to 0 and ca n’t be changed .
wave determines the default size of a widget based on number of columns and the row height to ensure that the widgets are readable and retain their relative sizes .
• change the color of the designer grid and the gutter that appears when the device ’s screen size is wider than the maximum width of the dashboard .
265 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights • specify horizontal alignment options for number and text widgets . • use bindings to dynamically set the dataset name in the load  statement of a saql query .
you can also use them to replace the entire string for a query as shown here .

take advantage of the latest saql functionality wave ’s saql functionality continues to expand with new helper functions , performance tips , and support for null measures .
date and time helper functions the new date and time helper functions enable manipulation of the date type .
the functions produce scalar values and can be used in a projection clause or in filter by clauses in post - projection .
you can not use them within group by or order by in pre - projection . •

support for null measures 273 salesforce spring release notes wave analytics : easier , personal insights measures in wave are dataset columns that contain numerical values .
enabling null measure handling lets you distinguish between null and non - null values —
for example , the number 0— in numerical data .
saql support for null measures facilitates this preference , for example , when using aggregation , comparison , and math functions , and for order by or group by clauses .
support for null measures is enabled in orgs created during or after the spring release .
with existing orgs , an admin can turn it on .
for more information , see get better results with null measure handling .
tips to avoid query performance pitfalls the saql reference now contains details on how to improve performance by adopting best practices in query design , based on real - life cases .
for more information , see the wave analytics saql reference .
review updates to the rest api for wave the rest api for wave has new endpoints and representations .
schedule trending reports the apis for trending report snapshots in wave — get and post on /wave / trendedreports and get and patch on /wave / trendedreports/<id>—have been extended and now support timed daily , weekly , monthly , and relative monthly scheduling .
create custom map charts wave custom map charts are supported through the following new endpoints : /eclair / maps get the collection of maps , or post a new map . /eclair
/ maps/<id > get or update a specific map . /eclair
/ geodata get the collection of geodata definitions , or post a new one . /eclair
/ geodata/<id > get or update a specific geodata definition . /eclair

migrate or deploy your customizations with packageable user xmd wave packaging adds support for user xmd .
metadata api , change set and packaging support for wave assets provide an excellent platform for creating and deploying wave apps , and now you have the ability to package and deploy user xmd too .
user xmd is a json document that allows an application to override certain metadata for a dataset .
you can govern settings to control how the data is presented — for example , colors , formats , and labels .
to deploy the overridden dataset metadata , you must package the user xmd attributes .
metadata api support allows migration tools to migrate datasets with user xmd between orgs — for example , you can migrate user xmd overrides from sandbox to production .
partners can deploy their application - specific user xmd with their appexchange package .
they retain control of the user xmd and can update it with future package versions .

editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions tip :  there ’s lots of lightning striking salesforce these days —
lightning experience , lightning bolts , lightning components — and it can be tricky to know how it all applies to communities .
here 's the rundown .
lightning bolt solutions and community templates use the same underlying technology as lightning experience — namely , the lightning platform and lightning components — but you are n’t required to enable lightning experience to use them .
although communities is available in lightning experience setup , it is n’t fully supported in lightning experience because the global header is n’t available .
the global header is used to switch internal users between their salesforce org and their communities .
without the global header , internal users need to bookmark community urls to access communities they 're members of .
if you enable lightning experience in your org , internal users must switch back to salesforce classic to access the global header .

prepare your communities for tls 1.0 disablement
starting on july 22nd , 2017 , salesforce is disabling support for tls 1.0 ( transport layer security protocol ) for all orgs in production .
after this date , any inbound connections to or outbound connections from your salesforce org will require the tls 1.1 or tls 1.2 encryption protocol .
this change affects user access to communities , customer portals , partner portals , and sites built on force.com and site.com .
server - side access checks for events enforced for custom components in communities access checks for lightning components are now enforced on both the server side and the client side .
previously , only client - side access check failures were enforced and resulted in a partially functional component .
now , if a component references an event for which it does n't have access , server - side access checks result in the component failing to load .
to ensure that your custom components load correctly , test your code and ensure that event attributes are correctly set .

however : • for koa and kokua , general settings , such as category group name , top - level category , and company name , carry over . •
for customer service ( napili ) , topic definitions carry over .
most branding properties defined using the branding editor in community builder are maintained .
however , sometimes your community ’s colors are reset to the default value .
after you update the template , check the branding properties and update the ones that were reset .
winter ’16 ( october 2015 ) koa , kokua , or customer service ( napili ) •
your customizations are maintained for all pages , except login pages . •
login pages retain branding , but lose custom code or component customizations .
note :  if your community uses the winter ’16 ( october 2015 ) version of koa , kokua , or customer service ( napili ) , it ’s a good idea to update your template version now .
the winter ’16 template uses the lightning platform and lightning components in all pages except the login pages .
support for winter ’16 will be discontinued in a future release .
prepare your communities for tls 1.0 disablement

after this date , any inbound connections to or outbound connections from your salesforce org will require the tls 1.1 or tls 1.2 encryption protocol .
this change affects user access to communities , customer portals , partner portals , and sites built on force.com and site.com .
at salesforce , trust is our highest priority , and we take the protection of our customers ' data very seriously .
we ’re disabling tls 1.0 so we can maintain the highest security standards , ensure the safety of your data , and align with industry - wide best practices .
as a result of this change , browser access , inbound api integrations , and call - out integrations are required to be compliant with tls 1.1 or above .
we encourage you to prep your org and inform your community , portal , and site audiences about this upcoming change .
all licensed and unlicensed visitors must use browsers and browser settings that are compliant with tls 1.1 or above .
to prepare for this change ahead of time : • inform both licensed and unlicensed guest users about browser requirements for tls version compatibility and consider adding appropriate messaging to your communities , portals , and sites . • encourage users to check their browsers for compatibility with tls 1.1 or above early on with our test site .
if their browser is compliant , the web site displays a “ test passed ” message .
• ensure that the tls 1.1 or above are enabled for your api integrations .

285 salesforce spring release notes server - side access checks for events enforced for custom components in communities server - side access checks for events enforced for custom components in communities access checks for lightning components are now enforced on both the server side and the client side .
previously , only client - side access check failures were enforced and resulted in a partially functional component .
now , if a component references an event for which it does n't have access , server - side access checks result in the component failing to load .
to ensure that your custom components load correctly , test your code and ensure that event attributes are correctly set .
how does this affect my community pages ?
without the appropriate value set for the access attribute for events , components that reference these events do n’t load on community pages .
for public community pages , the access system attribute must be set to global .
for pages that are n’t public , the access system attribute can be set to public or global , depending on your code .
if a component references an event and the component does n’t have access to the event : • client - side code does n’t run or returns undefined .
you see an error message in your browser console if you enabled debug mode .
• client - side code does n’t run or returns undefined .
you see an error message in your browser console if you enabled debug mode .
what errors are displayed in my published community ?
previously , custom lightning component with access check errors only displayed error messages .

see what goes where with better visual feedback while building labels on theme and content layout regions make it easier to drag and drop lightning components where you want them on your pages .
gain control of each page layout with theme layout types looking for more granular control over the layout of each page in your community ?
with theme layouts and theme layout types , that ’s exactly what you get !
previously , a theme layout applied to all the pages in your community .
but with theme layout types , you can apply theme layouts to individual pages and easily switch layouts from one central location .
and for developers , we ’ve introduced the ability to add properties to custom theme layouts , which are configurable in the theme area .
this feature is available in communities using the customer service ( napili ) template .

community workspaces offers a streamlined area to access all the tools that you need for building , managing , and tracking your community .
even though it looks different , everything you use is still there .
some things have been moved around a bit .
engagement reports have been moved into the dashboard workspace .
reporting dashboards and your home dashboards are also located in the dashboard workspace . 289 salesforce spring release notes usability and design improvements : refreshed tools , more design control recommendations and topics are in the new content targeting workspace .
moderation pages have been organized into separate areas within the moderation workspace .
you can access moderation insights from the home tab and create and customize moderation rules , member criteria , and content criteria from the rules tab .
290 salesforce spring release notes usability and design improvements : refreshed tools , more design control want to jump to another workspace from the workspace you are in ?
it ’s easy !
click the icon in the upper - left corner and a navigation dropdown menu appears .
you can also switch between communities without leaving community workspaces .
community builder gets more elbow room the new and improved community builder gives you more room to work , lets you focus on designing and configuring , and provides easier access to tools .
you no longer have to switch between editors , whether you ’re adding and configuring components , customizing branding , adding pages , or adjusting settings .
as part of this improved workflow , we made the following changes .
left - hand side changes the panels on the left - hand side now slide out of sight when you do n’t need them . 291 salesforce spring release notes usability and design improvements : refreshed tools , more design control •
access your other workspaces from the streamlined communities menu ( 1 ) .
• use the pages and page variations menus ( 2 ) to jump to pages and page properties .
• access lightning components ( 3 ) and the page structure ( 5 ) in different panels . •
the branding editor ( 4 ) is now called branding .
page structure panel easier to find page structure now has its own panel .
view all components on the current page , and select a component to bring it quickly into view .
page properties
redesigned looking for all the settings from the page manager area ?
they ’re now consolidated in the page properties area available from the pages menu .
to open properties for the current page , click hover over the page name in the pages menu and click next to the page name in the toolbar .
to open properties for any page in your community , .
292 salesforce spring release notes usability and design improvements : refreshed tools , more design control
from the centralized properties area , create pages , manage page variations , and set the page ’s layout properties in one easy - to - use location .
the new page option is available from the pages menu and a page layout area has been added .
see what goes where with better visual feedback while building labels on theme and content layout regions make it easier to drag and drop lightning components where you want them on your pages .
when you drag a component into a theme layout region , the region name appears to help you place the component .
a component in a theme layout region appears on every page that uses the theme layout .
the shared label indicates components that appear on other pages . 293 salesforce spring release notes usability and design improvements : refreshed tools , more design control when you drag a component into a content layout region , the region name appears to help you place the component .
a component in a content layout region is specific to a single page .
components in content layout regions do n’t have the shared label .
gain control of each page layout with theme layout types looking for more granular control over the layout of each page in your community ?
with theme layouts and theme layout types , that ’s exactly what you get !
previously , a theme layout applied to all the pages in your community .
but with theme layout types , you can apply theme layouts to individual pages and easily switch layouts from one central location .
and for developers , we ’ve introduced the ability to add properties to custom theme layouts , which are configurable in the theme area .
this feature is available in communities using the customer service ( napili ) template .
a theme layout defines the top - level regions of your page , such as the header and footer , navigation , search , and the user profile menu .
a theme layout type is used to categorize the pages in your community that share the same theme layout .
in settings > theme in community builder , assign theme layouts to existing types or create custom types for more flexibility .
then apply the theme layout type in the page ’s properties .
customer service ( napili ) includes the following default theme layout types and theme layouts , but you can create custom types or switch layouts as needed . •
home applies the customer service theme layout to the home page . •
login applies the login body layout theme layout to the login pages .
•
inner applies the customer service theme layout theme to all other pages .
example :  let ’s say you create three pages for your upcoming spring campaign .
you want them to use the large header theme layout .
in the theme area , you create a custom theme layout type called spring to categorize these pages and assign the large header layout to it .
294 salesforce spring release notes usability and design improvements : refreshed tools , more design control next , you apply the spring theme layout type in each page ’s properties , which instantly applies the large header layout to each page .
everything looks rosy until your vp of marketing decides that the header takes up too much room .
because you do n’t have to update the properties of each page to change the theme layout , that ’s an easy fix .
with one click in the theme area , you can switch spring to the small header layout and instantly update all three pages ! 295
salesforce spring release notes usability and design improvements : refreshed tools , more design control example : now let ’s say that the small header layout includes two custom properties —
property a and property b — which you ’ve enabled and applied to all your campaign pages .
however , for one page , you want to apply only property b. in this case , you could create a theme layout type called spring b , assign the small header layout to it , and enable property b. then , you simply apply the spring b layout type to the page .
theme layout types make it easy to reuse the same theme layout in several different ways , while maintaining as much granular control as you need .
find and create asset files from community builder customizing your community with images for your header , logo , or custom components just got easier .
upload and select images using the file selector .
once uploaded , files are converted to packageable asset files and stored in your org asset library for easy reference and retrieval .
from community builder , click an image icon in the branding panel to open the unified file selector .
the file selector displays only image files , so you do n’t have to wade through all your files to find your logo or header image .
if the image file you want is already an asset file , it ’s in the asset library , which is clearly marked by the org asset library badge .
asset files for your salesforce org and all your communities are stored in the org asset library , so you do n’t need to maintain copies in different places . 296 salesforce spring release notes usability and design improvements : refreshed tools , more design control when you add an image to your community for the first time , an asset file is automatically created and stored in the org asset library .
admins have full access to the org asset library and can search for , tag , and subscribe to asset files .
anyone with “
customize application ” and “ create and set up communities ” permissions can access the org asset library .
to provide access to others , add them as members of the library with the appropriate permissions .
users without these permissions do n’t see the org asset library .
the org asset library is available in all new orgs , and is automatically activated in existing orgs .
note :  if public access is enabled in community builder at the page or community level , the let guest users view asset files on public pages preference is enabled in administration | preferences .
this preference remains enabled as long as any page has public access enabled .
quick configuration for custom domains configure https for custom domains using easy peasy radio buttons .
now you can quickly select how your custom domain is configured by selecting from easy - to - read radio buttons .
go to setup > administer > domain management > domains to make your selection .
reset your password the easy way
previously , if you had a customer self - service user with the same salesforce and community username , the reset password email would fail to send .
you would then have to do some fancy footwork to receive it .
now that has been resolved .
when users click the “ forgot password ” link , the email containing instructions to reset the user ’s password is delivered correctly .
control capitalization of titles in your community use the new text case property in the fonts section of the branding panel to quickly adjust the case of titles in your community .
the text case property affects all out - of - the - box components such as the navigation menu , ask button , profile header , and headline .
you can use lowercase or initial capitals in addition to all uppercase .
you can also leave the text unformatted to use the component ’s default font formatting .
297 salesforce spring release notes focus your community with audience targeting for pages and groups focus your community with audience targeting for pages and groups
in addition to profiles , you can now add location and record type criteria to page variations and hit your target audience .
for example , by combining criteria , you can have a page that ’s visible only to sales users in canada or create a custom group geared just to that set of users .
here are some considerations when using criteria to target an audience . •
if you have multiple page variations , the page with the most assigned criteria is displayed .
if you have pages with similar criteria , the rank of the criteria determines which page is displayed .
priority is determined in this order : – profile – record type – location going from the most specific ( like state ) to the most general ( like country )
for example , you have two pages with the profile criteria set to sales user .
one also uses the record type criteria while the other uses location .
the page set to sales user and record type displays because record type has a high priority . •
the profile criteria determines the navigation menu items .
for example , if you turned off an item for a sales user profile , it ’s off regardless of any additional criteria . 298 salesforce spring release notes package lightning bolt solutions more easily location criteria have a few more specific items to note . •
location is actually the user ’s ip location , which could potentially be located in a neighboring area . •
the location permission is not on by default in developer edition orgs .
contact salesforce if you want to use this feature in that edition .
• use of google api is not permitted in some countries .
location criteria do n’t work for those areas .
package lightning bolt solutions more easily exported and packaged lightning bolt solutions now support more page types and properties .
at its simplest , a lightning bolt solution comprises an exported template that ’s made up of a theme layout and css , along with pages , content layouts , and lightning components .
bolt solutions seamlessly integrate with salesforce and incorporate business logic , custom objects , and industry best practices .
tip :  lightning bolt solutions and community templates use the same underlying technology as lightning experience — namely , the lightning platform and lightning components — but you are n’t required to enable lightning experience to use them .
when you export and package a lightning bolt solution , we now support : • login pages • page - level properties • asset files • theme layout properties and types note :  under setup , we changed : • lightning community templates to lightning bolt solutions • lightning community pages to lightning bolt pages see also :

the force : hasrecordid  interface makes a component context - aware by adding the record id from the component ’s page to the component at runtime .
for example , a component on a record page receives the record id of the currently displayed record .
previously , the force : hasrecordid  interface was supported in lightning app builder and salesforce1 only .
now it ’s supported in communities as well .
if you already created components that implement the interface , you can use them in community builder .
if you have components that include expression language to obtain the record id , there ’s no need to remove the expression language .
expressions take precedence over the force : hasrecordid  interface .
note :  to make your lightning components available for communities , you still need the forcecommunity : availableforallpagetypes interface .
see also : lightning components developer guide : configure components for lightning experience record pages access lightning apps in public communities add the ltng : allowguestaccess interface to your lightning app to make it available to users without requiring that they register with or log in to your community .
this interface makes your lightning app available to more people , with fewer barriers to using it .
note :  you can only add the ltng : allowguestaccess  interface to lightning apps , not to individual components .
once you ’ve enabled your app for guest access , your app is available as a stand - alone lightning app at the following url : https://yourcommunitydomain / communityurl / namespace / appname.app . stand - alone lightning apps do n’t display any salesforce branding , nor do they use your community template .
you have complete control over the visual design of a stand - alone app .
here ’s an example that shows you how to translate your org ’s settings into the url to your app . •
you set your community domain to “ universalcontainers.force.com ” . •
you do n’t have a namespace defined for your org . •
you ’ve created a community with the url “ ourstores ” . 312 salesforce spring release notes •
you ’ve added implements="ltng : allowguestaccess "  to a lightning app named “ locator.app ” .
the url to your lightning app is : https://universalcontainers.force.com/ourstores/c/locator.app .
chatter and files in community templates : create custom groups , track top posts , filter questions , share posts , and more important :  when you make a lightning app accessible to guest users by adding the ltng : allowguestaccess  interface , it ’s available through every community in your org , whether that community is enabled for public access or not .
you ca n’t prevent it from being accessible via community urls , and you ca n’t make it available for some communities but not others .
warning :  be extremely careful about apps you open for guest access .
apps enabled for guest access bypass the object- and field - level security ( fls ) you set for your community ’s guest user profile .
lightning components do n’t automatically enforce crud and fls when you reference objects or retrieve the objects from an apex controller .
this means that the framework continues to display records and fields for which users do n’t have crud access and fls visibility .
you must manually enforce crud and fls in your apex controllers .
a mistake in code used in an app enabled for guest access can open your org ’s data to the world .

communities documentation : spruced up for spring with the ui getting a new look , we felt that it was time to do some housekeeping with our documentation .
we retired some doc and we also moved things around to consolidate our content into fewer pdfs and make it searchable from the salesforce help .
so what ’s changing ? • we retired the getting started with communities implementation guide .
all the information from this implementation guide already lives in the salesforce help , which is fully searchable and translated into all our supported languages .
if you prefer to download your content , use the set up and manage communities guide instead .
it has all the help topics consolidated into a single pdf . •
if you use partner portals , we strongly recommend that you migrate your portal to a community .
communities support portal licenses , so you do n't need to get additional communities licenses .
we added a ton of new content for managing partner relationships and using the lightning partner management solution to create partner communities . •
we also removed the partner portal documentation from the salesforce help and moved it all into the create and manage partner portals guide . •
we updated all our documentation to show that you can access communities whether your org uses salesforce classic or lightning experience .
the only exception to this is , of course , the global header , which is only supported in salesforce classic . •

327 salesforce spring release notes chatter feeds : create custom feeds , share posts , love live comments
what ’s encrypted ?
chatter encryption applies to feed posts , questions and answers , link names , and all comments .
it also applies to poll questions , but not poll choices .
encrypted fields work normally throughout the salesforce user interface , business processes , and apis .
( there are some exceptions ; for example , you ca n’t filter encrypted fields . )
when you encrypt a field , existing values are n't encrypted immediately .
values are encrypted only after you interact with them , for example , you add or edit field content .
important :  historic chatter feeds ca n’t be mass - encrypted .
enabling encryption for chatter disables spam iq and exposes chatter to the global limitations that come with encryption .

now , every group can have its own layout .
this means components , actions , publisher , and related lists can all be customized to meet a given use case perfectly .
example :  a group devoted to closing opportunities could have a chart showing key success indicators in the upper right column , other components holding key sales collateral , associated records like opportunities , training videos showing sales techniques — the sky is the limit .

apply irm control to track information such as the number of times a file has been downloaded . •
flag suspicious files before download and redirect them for antivirus scanning .
the new sfc  namespace contains apex objects for customizing the behavior of salesforce files after they are downloaded .
contentdownloadhandlerfactory provides an interface for customizing file downloads .
the contentdownloadhandler class defines values related to whether download is allowed , and what to do otherwise .
the contentdownloadcontext  enum is the context in which the download takes place .
file download customization was introduced as a pilot feature in summer ’16 , and is now generally available .
here ’s what ’s new in spring : • apex support for all files in multi - file downloads from the content tab in salesforce classic .
a new apex function signature list < id > handles a list of file ids rather than a single id . •
support for content packs and content distributions .
list < id >  is a list of the version ids in the contentpack  or contentdistribution . •
setting .isdownloadallowed = false  on a multi - file or contentpack  download causes the entire download to fail . you can pass a list of the problem files back to an error page via url parameters in redirecturl .
here ’s some sample code you can copy and paste to get started . //
download customization based on user profile public class blockuserdownload implements sfc .
contentdownloadhandlerfactory { public sfc .
contentdownloadhandler getcontentdownloadhandler(list < id > ids , sfc . contentdownloadcontext c ) { sfc .

if your org uses salesforce crm content , salesforce1 for ios users can attach official corporate files and other curated content from public content libraries to a record feed , making sharing files to relevant groups and discussions easier than ever .
this new feature is available in version 12.0 or later of the salesforce1 for ios downloadable app .
if salesforce crm content is already up and running for your org , there ’s nothing special to do for your salesforce1 for ios users and there ’s nothing new for your salesforce1 users to learn because they already know how to access libraries from the existing files interface , and now they can attach files from content libraries to posts as well .
users see all the public libraries that they have access to in the full site and have the same file sharing permissions in salesforce1 that they do in the full site .
view posts in salesforce1 that were shared in lightning experience feeds in salesforce1 now include posts shared from chatter in lightning experience .
but the full content of these shared posts does n’t appear directly in certain feeds in the salesforce1 downloadable apps .
in these cases , users see who shared a post but must take an extra step to see other details .
in contrast , salesforce1 mobile browser app users see the content of posts shared in lightning experience directly in all their feeds .
and posts shared in salesforce classic or the salesforce1 downloadable apps continue to appear directly in feeds in all  flavors of salesforce1 .
when a post shared in lightning experience appears in these feeds in the salesforce1 downloadable apps , tap the view post link to see the post ’s content ( 1 ) . • main chatter feed • feeds on profiles ( salesforce1 for ios app only )
in other feeds in the salesforce1 downloadable apps , such as group feeds , record feeds , and profile feeds in salesforce1 for android , the content of posts shared in lightning experience appears directly in the feed — the same way posts shared in salesforce classic or the salesforce1 downloadable apps appear in feeds in all salesforce1 flavors ( 2 ) .
348 salesforce spring release notes salesforce1 : better task management and more sales data see also : share posts in lightning experience make calls or send email from profiles in salesforce1 reaching colleagues while on the go just got faster for your salesforce1 for android downloadable app and salesforce1 mobile browser app users .
phone and email fields on profiles — in the highlights area and on the record detail page — are now links that users can tap to instantly start a call or send an email message .
salesforce1 for ios users have always been able to do these actions on colleagues’ profiles .
but salesforce1 for android and the mobile browser app take it up a notch because users can even send voice and email messages to themselves from their own profiles .
customize the offline cache in salesforce1 the offline experience for salesforce1 downloadable app users keeps getting better and better .
we ’re giving users the power to choose the data they want to access offline .
before users had the power to choose , the data in the users’ offline cache was a collection of recently accessed records for the first five objects listed in the recent section of their salesforce1 navigation menu .
now users can tailor their offline cache so they can work with the data that matters the most to them , even if their mobile device loses its network signal .
this new feature is available in the salesforce1 downloadable apps for android and ios , version 12.0 or later .
the new offline preferences page lets users quickly and easily choose the data they want in their cache .
users can choose up to seven items , and if they change their minds they can easily toggle on and off the items listed in the offline preferences page .
if users choose not to tailor their cache , salesforce1 continues to collect recently accessed records for the first five objects listed in the recent section of the users’ salesforce1 navigation menu to populate their cache .
however , if users choose at least one item from the offline preferences page , that selection replaces the existing cache with their new preferences .
349 salesforce spring release notes salesforce1 : better task management and more sales data after users choose the items they want in their cache from the offline preferences page , they can quickly populate their cache in two ways .
users can put salesforce1 in the background by switching away to a different app or navigating to their device ’s home screen to populate their cache .
or users can go to the salesforce1 navigation menu , select settings > offline cache > cache now .
unified create and edit experience in salesforce1 for online and offline sessions
previously when salesforce1 downloadable app users created or edited records when working online , there was a delay while the app confirmed the updates .
wait times varied , depending on a mobile device ’s network signal strength .
now when users create or edit records — whether online or offline — updates are saved as pending changes .
users can immediately move on to additional work in salesforce1 while the app syncs the pending changes with salesforce .
this feature is new in the salesforce1 downloadable apps for android and ios , version 11.0 or later .
350 salesforce spring release notes salesforce1 : better task management and more sales data new and improved web view available in salesforce1 for ios based on customer feedback and apple ’s recommendation , salesforce1 for ios is transitioning from apple ’s legacy uiwebview to its new wkwebview for improved performance and better user experience .
the upgrade to wkwebview provides a faster and more stable experience in salesforce1 for ios , including 30% faster performance , 70% reduction in memory usage , and resolution of many long - standing web content known issues .
this upgrade is available in the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios , version 12.0 or later .
note :  salesforce1 for ios version 12.0 requires ios version 10.0 or later .
users earlier version of ios wo n’t be able to upgrade to salesforce1 for ios version 12.0 .
for help upgrading ios , see update the ios software on your iphone , ipad , or ipod touch on the apple support site .
the upgrade to wkwebview is a performance enhancement that provides a faster and more stable user experience .
however , if you have implemented any workarounds within custom visualforce pages to address known issues with uiwebview ( for example scrolling , button , or field tap issues ) , those workarounds may not work when users upgrade to salesforce1 for ios version 12.0 .
if your org does contain custom visualforce pages , salesforce recommends testing and reviewing custom visualforce implementations to identify any issues .
users can log in to salesforce1 through mobile safari on an ios device running ios version 10.0 or later to test custom visualforce implementations .
for full instructions on testing and resolving custom visualforce implementations , see the new and improved web view available in salesforce1 for ios version 12.0 knowledge article .
go from external apps directly into visualforce and lightning apps in salesforce1 for ios
currently when users tap on a salesforce url hyperlink or enter a salesforce url into a browser address bar on a mobile device , they ’re taken directly into the salesforce1 downloadable app .
this functionality did n’t support taking users directly into visualforce apps and lightning apps within the salesforce1 downloadable app .
now when users tap on a salesforce url for a visualforce app or lightning app , they ’re taken directly to either a visualforce app or lightning app in salesforce1 .
this feature saves users time from having to manually navigate to a visualforce app or lightning app in salesforce1 .
this awesomeness is available in the salesforce1 downloadable app for ios , version 12.0 or later . 351 salesforce spring release notes salesforce1 : better task management and more sales data
for example , a user can send a salesforce url for a custom lightning app to a coworker .
simply by tapping the salesforce url , a coworker on an ios device can automatically open the lightning app in the salesforce1 downloadable app .

for example , do n’t use the risk stratification feature for any purposes related to health care reimbursement by medicare , medicaid , other federal or state health programs , or private health insurers . use wave for health cloud : risk stratification in compliance with hipaa and other health privacy laws .
in particular , hipaa contains a “
minimum necessary requirement ” that mandates what information a health care organization 's employees and contractors can see .
these individuals must only access the minimum amount of protected health information ( phi ) necessary to perform their job functions .
wave for health cloud : risk stratification exposes phi for all patients within your organization .
only grant feature access to individuals who have a valid need to know the phi of all individuals your company treats .
for example , limit access to hospital administrators or those people responsible for quality of care initiatives who already can see phi for all individuals .
it is your responsibility to determine which individuals within your organization can access this feature and then to set the appropriate permissions .
as a default , this feature is unavailable to licensed health cloud users .
health cloud now has delivered a wave risk scoring dashboard based on the cms hierarchical condition categories ( hcc ) risk scoring model .
the cms hcc model looks at patient diagnoses and other key demographic information to assign a risk score to each patient .
the dashboard helps people like clinical administrators or executives get a complete view of the trends affecting patients being cared for .
a dashboard is a curated set of charts , metrics , and tables based on the data in one or more lenses .
when you look at data in an exploratory mode , you do so in a lens .
a lens has several aspects : it ’s how you view data in a dataset , it ’s the place where you explore the data graphically , and it ’s the basis for building any dashboard .
those individuals with permission to access the app can apply filters 365 salesforce spring release notes manage patient risk with wave for health cloud : risk stratification in a lens to focus on the subset of data that ’s most relevant .
for example , filters can limit the visualization to certain calendar years or patient populations .
the wave for health cloud : risk stratification app comes with charts and lists that give you important insight into the overall health of the patients you manage .
each health cloud org gets five wave app permission set licenses . •
risk score ( 1 ) : the number of patients being evaluated and the number of patients who fall into each risk band category . 366 salesforce spring release notes manage patient risk with wave for health cloud : risk stratification • risk score trends ( 2 ) : the number of patients in the program and the average risk score in a calendar year compared with the numbers from the preceding year . • age group ( 3 ) : the number of covered patients in each age group . • age group trends ( 4 ) : the number of male and female covered patients in the program in a given calendar year compared with the numbers from the preceding year . • patient distribution by number of conditions ( 5 ) : the number of patients who have one or more medical conditions . • patient distribution trends ( 6 ) : the number of patients with one or more conditions compared with the numbers from the preceding year . • enrollment type ( 7 ) : the number of patients enrolled in each program type . • enrollment type trends ( 8) : the number of patients enrolled in each program type compared with the numbers from the preceding year
. • patient details ( 9 ) :
a list of patients with their associated risk score , conditions , hierarchical condition categories ( hcc ) codes , and so on .
you can grant permission to let users download a .csv file of the patient list .
the list can be used to assign at - risk patients to a care management program and then manage them in health cloud .
clicking the elements within a widget can also change the view of the entire dashboard .
for example , here is a section of the dashboard that shows age groups and patient distribution based on number of conditions .
after selecting patients in 60–64 years old age group , the charts and graphs change to reflect that lens .
367 salesforce spring release notes seamlessly convert leads into patients the filtered information is also reflected in the patient details list .
the patient list can be shared with other individuals who have permission to view information for all patients .
tip :  if you haven’t used wave before , learn more about it from the wave analytics library .
seamlessly convert leads into patients give care coordinators the power to convert salesforce leads into health cloud patients — each with their own care plan and care team .
when you install the health cloud unmanaged package extension care coordinators select up to 200 leads , and let the system create the necessary records for that individual .
using leads to add patients allows seamless support from patient acquisition through enrollment in health cloud .
leads can be acquired in sales cloud , service cloud , or from an integration with an ( electronic health record ( ehr ) system , data warehouse , patient registration system , or call center .
for example , a care coordinator can easily enroll a person who has contacted your company ’s call center through a chronic care program .
368 salesforce spring release notes faster load times for the patient timeline for each patient , salesforce performs the following actions .
• creates the patient as an individual .
an individual is an object view of both account and contact linked by the individual id .
• creates an account for the individual that is linked to the patient id and mrn fields .
• creates a contact record for the individual that is linked to the account through the individual id .
• creates a case with a careplan record type so that the page layout for the care plan appears automatically .
if a care coordinator has been selected , the coordinator becomes the owner of the case .
• adds the case that represents the care plan to the account record .
• creates a case team with the individual as the patient , and adds the care coordinator , when one has been selected . • adds the patient ’s account id to the patient record .
faster load times for the patient timeline we ’ve given you the option to show only a subset of events when the timeline first appears in the console — dramatically improving load times for the page .
the timeline contains a personal history of each patient , which sometimes is a lot of information to load .
although good things are worth waiting for , you can now whittle down the initial view to quickly load only the most important events .
after that , care coordinators can use the events filter to select which extra events they ’d like to view for a particular patient .
all timeline configurations that have the active  option selected are available to appear on the timeline when they ’re selected using the events filter .
but only those configuration records with the show on load  setting selected appear on the timeline by default .
for existing health cloud customers , we automatically select show on load for every active timeline view configuration record you already have in the org .
you can then decide if you want to change the setting in the configuration records to decrease the timeline ’s initial load time .
health cloud has new custom objects health cloud contains new custom objects .

sample related record component component properties in lightning app builder : component displaying a case ’s related contact : component displaying a case ’s related parent case : let ’s take a walk in your users’ shoes .
say that you set up this component to display contact information for a case .
however , a user opens a case that does n’t have a related contact .
with this component , they can create a contact or link one , all without leaving the 377 salesforce spring release notes lightning app builder : record page assignment by record type and profile , new page templates , new components , and more page .
and if they later find out that the contact info is out of date , they can update the details in - line .
and if the info is incorrect , they can simply remove ( unlink ) the record and add a new record .
hooray for always staying in context !
component displaying no linked record : component displaying inline edit : note : • cases are linked to default accounts that ca n't be removed ( unlinked ) from the component unless the contact is also removed at the same time . •
to use the parent case and asset lookup fields on cases , update the field - level security to visible instead of hidden .
otherwise , your users see an error .
when you ’re ready to use this component , head over to the lightning app builder and edit or create a custom record page .

you can create a flow based on a registered external service schema without writing code .
for example , let ’s say you want to create a flow for a credit service .
include a record lookup step so that the service accesses a specific account .
you can also include a credit - worthiness evaluation and a step that updates the account with the evaluation results .
your flow might look something like this one .

external lookup relationship fields now display the names of parent records , which are much more meaningful to your users than the ids that were displayed .
this change applies to salesforce classic only .
in lightning experience , external lookup relationships already display names instead of ids .
previously , an external lookup field in salesforce classic displayed either the parent object id or the value of the parent object ’s external id standard field .
the external id standard field appeared by default .
if , however , a custom field on the parent object had the is name field attribute , the parent object id was displayed .
this behavior can still occur , but only if your org hasn’t yet retrieved the parent record .
if you see an id in an external lookup field , reload the page to replace the id with the name .

when you run reports that reference external objects via lookup , external lookup , and indirect lookup relationships , you no longer receive empty values for those relationship fields .

with the cross - org adapter for salesforce connect , a report callout no longer fails if its url exceeds 2 kb .

your flow might need the id of the record that it ’s operating on , but do n’t worry !

example :  here ’s how a flow called survey customers appears when embedded in a record page in lightning experience . 390 salesforce spring release notes visual workflow : have more control over your screens changes
since last release we changed how you pass the record id from a record page into a flow .
previously , you configured a variable with a specific name .
now you can pass the record id to any text variable , no matter what your naming convention is .
to do so , select the checkbox under the appropriate text variable .
if you created a text input variable called recordid  for the flow component during winter , the checkbox is automatically selected when your org upgrades to spring .
this default selection happens only when your org upgrades to spring .
if you create a text variable called recordid  in spring or later , the checkbox is not selected by default .

each field rule consists of conditions ( 1 ) and field settings ( 2 ) .
the conditions specify when to execute the rule .
the field settings let you control whether the field is visible , hidden , required , or optional .
example :  you want to ask your users how they prefer to be contacted .

405 salesforce spring release notes authentication and identity : enhanced verification requirements , more oauth options , connected apps enhancements
but what about the connected apps that do n’t have a link to the app ’s detail page ?
these apps were created by developers in another org .
users can connect to them because oauth apps are available throughout salesforce .
however , you ca n’t manage their security policies because they ’re not installed in your org .
until now .
with this release , you can install the apps locally so that you can manage them .
click install next to the app and the manage app policies link appears .
click the link to go to the app ’s detail page , and then click edit policies to modify the policies to meet your access and security needs .
after you ’ve installed the app , the button changes to uninstall .
however , it ’s recommended that you uninstall an app only when the original developer deletes the app on the other org .
uninstall does n’t remove the connected app .
instead , it removes the oauth policies that you set for the app in your org .
you ’re actually loosening your security measures .
to make the connected app inaccessible to your org ’s users , click block .
blocking an app ends all current user sessions with the connected app and blocks all new sessions .
you can restore access to the app by clicking unblock .

available in all editions editions the internet of things introduces new requirements for the security tokens used to manage connected products . •
open , self - describing , and contextual —
devices must talk to various backend systems , requiring a token format based on open standards .
tokens must carry metadata that enables both their verification and enable the enrichment of devices’ service requests with extra context about the device or customer . •
long term , high scale —
customers must be able to authorize a device , walk away , and have that device continue to act autonomously on their behalf .
these transactions are required for lots of devices , on behalf of lots of customers . •
delegated , constrained authorization —
a device can act on a user 's behalf but only in a limited capacity , according to the specific rights that the user granted to the device .
• spectrum of assurance — devices have varying capabilities and needs for protection based on their manufacturing cost and use cases they support .
devices require a spectrum of capabilities ranging from self - asserted ids to certificates that allow proof of possession of private keys and verification of manufacturer .
• integrated with crm — connected products are an extension of a company ’s brand and customer interactions .
integrating these interactions with the company ’s crm platform is essential .
salesforce identity has designed asset tokens with the unique requirements of iot devices in mind .
• open source jwt - based tokens —
asset tokens are based on the json web token ( jwt ) standard as defined in rfc 7519 .
this format is simple , extensible , and secure .
it ’s easy for humans to work with , while being relatively compact , making it a good fit for devices .
408 salesforce spring release notes authentication and identity : enhanced verification requirements , more oauth options , connected apps enhancements • automatic integration with salesforce —
asset tokens include a registration protocol , allowing a device to be linked to the asset object and custom business processes .
asset token issuance allows dynamic asset creation , linking to an existing asset , or even linking to other salesforce data .
• extensible — asset tokens contain standard claims for security purposes , and can also carry custom attributes or permissions .
they can carry metadata for a wide variety of use cases and are fully extensible using the salesforce app cloud . • signatures and proof - of - possession —
asset tokens are signed by salesforce org - specific keys .
the tokens are self - describing , allowing for the verification process to be dynamically performed outside of salesforce .
also , device - specific keys and metadata can be bound into the token to provide assurance against tampering and support advanced use cases , such as proof of possession of a specific device key .

asset tokens enable more proactive support and more predictive engagement with your customers , on an unprecedented scale .
this feature is new in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
available in all editions editions for example , let ’s say that your customer purchases a connected device and registers an account with your support community .
your company offers an app , such as a mobile app or a provisioning gateway , that acts as an agent for device registration .
the app allows the user to connect to the device , log in to your support community , and register the device .
your community issues an asset token that identifies the device to your backend cloud service .
after registration , the device can operate independently of the app , routinely sending data about its state and operations to your backend service .
if the backend proactively detects an abnormal behavior or state , indicating an issue or potential issue , it automatically creates a case .
the case is associated with the asset , which is tied directly to the customer ’s contact record and your company ’s support process .
the device can also signal that resources such as ink toner are running low , predicting potential new opportunities to market and sell .
this diagram shows how asset tokens are issued , verified , and used to secure calls to backend services for a connected device .
detailed steps follow .
409 salesforce spring release notes authentication and identity : enhanced verification requirements , more oauth options , connected apps enhancements requesting and issuing asset tokens 1 .
the app that interacts with your device requests an access token for api access .
the app can be any application , such as a mobile app or a provisioning gateway , that serves as a bridge between the device and salesforce . 2 .
salesforce returns the access token .
3 .
the app communicates with your device to request metadata , which can include a name , device id , serial number , public key , or custom attributes .
4 .
the device returns the requested metadata .
5 .
the app sends its access token and device metadata to salesforce , requesting an asset token .
6 .
salesforce verifies the authenticity of the request and the authorization of the app and user
. 7 .
salesforce publishes an asset token event record and attempts to associate the device with an existing or new asset in the service cloud .
if you ’ve subscribed to receive platform events in apex triggers to support custom business processes , they execute .
8 .
salesforce returns the asset token to the app .
9 .
the app has now registered the asset and provides the asset token to the device , which can now operate independently from the app .
410 salesforce spring release notes authentication and identity : enhanced verification requirements , more oauth options , connected apps enhancements authorizing device access with asset tokens 1 .
the device presents its data or event to your backend service along with the asset token .
the backend service provides device functionality such as gathering telemetry data , monitoring device performance , and acting on behalf of the user . 2 .
your backend service requests the public key from salesforce .
3 .
salesforce returns the device - specific public key .
4 .
your backend service validates the asset token and determines whether the device is authorized for the requested operation .
5 .
optionally , your backend service can use the asset token to identify the salesforce account or contact who owns the device .
differences from the pilot and limitations • asset tokens were previously available through a pilot program .
in the pilot , asset token event data was saved in an asset token object .
this functionality is now provided by the asset token event object , new in api version 39.0 . •
asset tokens still ca n't be used as bearer tokens .
implementation prerequisites
before you implement asset tokens : •
my domain must be enabled . •
create a self - signed certificate for asset token use , signed with the sha-256 signature algorithm .
asset tokens are signed with this algorithm using a private key that is specific to , and protected by your salesforce org .
the private key can be verified using the corresponding public key in the asset token . • while not required , it ’s highly recommended that you enable salesforce identity for external users , so that your customers can register asset tokens .
if you follow the steps in the external identity implementation guide , complete the steps through implementation of self - registration .
confirm that you can log in to your community as an external user .
•
if you need a refresher on the json web token ( jwt ) format , we recommend reviewing the rfc 7519 specification .
review how claims work in a jwt , how jwts are encoded as a json object , and how the object is protected in a jws structure .
implementation steps
at a high level , implementing and using asset tokens involves these steps . 1 .
create an oauth - based connected app with asset tokens enabled .
the connected app is required for api access and for asset token issuance .
look for the new asset token settings in the oauth section when you create a connected app . 2 . acquire an access token using any app that supports the oauth 2.0 token exchange protocol .
access tokens enable authentication for api access .
they are required for asset token issuance and device registration .
for connected devices , an access token must be associated with a connected app that has asset tokens enabled .
if you ’re just getting familiar with asset tokens and want to get started quickly without completely setting up your own device , app , and backend , we offer the asset token explorer demo app .
the demo app simplifies your initial experience and lets you quickly get an access token that you can exchange for the asset token .
411 salesforce spring release notes authentication and identity : enhanced verification requirements , more oauth options , connected apps enhancements 3 .
create an asset token jwt .
parameters include : • grant_type — urn : ietf : params : oauth : grant - type : token - exchange • subject_token —
your access token •
actor_token —
optional jwt containing metadata about the device you ’re registering as a new or existing asset .
it can include a confirmation claim containing an rsa public key , in case your use case requires proof of possession of a private key .
4 .
post your asset token request to the salesforce oauth token endpoint . 5 .
salesforce returns an asset token .
the asset token is a jwt containing various claims about your device and any custom attributes or permissions that you defined in your connected app .
6 .
secure communications between the device and your backend service .
when the device presents it data or event to your backend service , it also provides the asset token .
common methods for securing communications between the device and your backend service are the bearer token sequence and the jwt bearer token exchange sequence .
in the bearer token sequence , the client presents the access token in the authorization header — with one token generated for each call .
in jwt bearer token exchange , the client generates the request , calls the target system to exchange its asset token , and receives an oauth token that it presents for subsequent calls .
this usage can be more efficient if you ’re orchestrating a series of calls or if the target is session - oriented .

help : create a connected app oauth 2.0 authentication flow for applications on limited input devices oauth 2.0 is now supported for applications on devices with limited input or display capabilities , such as tvs , appliances , or command - line applications .
configure a connected app with the new device flow setting , and design your device ’s user interface to prompt users for authorization to access their salesforce data .
this feature is new in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
here ’s how the device authentication flow works .
editions available in all editions 1 .
the device requests authorization from salesforce . 2 .
salesforce verifies the request and returns the following : human - readable user code , verification url , device code , and minimum polling interval ( in seconds ) .
3 .
the device displays the user code and instructs the user to enter it at the specified verification url .
4 .
on a separate device that has more developed input capabilities , such as a desktop computer or smartphone , the user opens a browser .
a. the user navigates to the verification url and is prompted to enter the user code .
413 salesforce spring release notes authentication and identity : enhanced verification requirements , more oauth options , connected apps enhancements b. if the code is valid , the user is prompted to log in if not already logged in . c.
after successful login , the user is prompted to allow the device to access salesforce data .
5 .
after displaying the user code and verification url , the device starts polling the token endpoint for authorization .
polling frequency ca n’t exceed the minimum polling interval .
the device continues polling until the user has allowed ( or denied ) access , or the user code has expired .
6 .
if allowed , the authorization server returns to the device an access token , a refresh token if requested , and other information .
7 .
after the access token is granted , the device can use it in api requests to access data on the user ’s behalf and use a refresh token to get a new access token if it becomes invalid .
to implement device flow for an oauth - enabled connected app , select enable for device flow in the connected app definition .
note the following about other oauth settings for device flows . •
a callback url is n’t used in this flow .
you can specify your own callback url as needed , such as when this same consumer is being used for a different flow .
if you do n’t specify your own callback url , the value defaults to a placeholder that you can ignore . • all supported scopes are allowed in device flows .
no scopes are selected by default .
specify desired scopes using the optional scope  parameter in the request that initiates the authentication flow .
after you save the connected app , make note of the consumer key .
you ’re required to pass it in the client_id  parameter when initiating a device flow request .
the consumer secret is not required .
you can optionally pass it in the client_secret  parameter when polling the token endpoint .
important :  the oauth 2.0 flow for limited input devices is generally available as of february 11 , 2017 .
before then , it ’s not available in sandboxes .

salesforce includes several authentication providers for social sign - on , including facebook , google , linkedin , twitter , and microsoft office 365 .
you can also create your own authentication provider to enable social sign - on from providers that salesforce does n’t support .
this feature was released in spring ’16 .
in this release , we ’ve added support for custom error handling and refresh tokens .
this feature is new in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
to enhance this feature , we replaced the apex authproviderplugin  interface with a new apex abstract class , authproviderpluginclass .
if you ’ve implemented a custom authentication provider using the authproviderplugin interface , do n’t worry , it still works .
however , if you want to add new functionality or implement a new provider , you must use the authproviderplugin  class .
414 salesforce spring release notes health check : import custom baselines and assign new permissions we ’ve also extended the authentication provider plug - in so that you can customize error handling .
when an exception is thrown , you can define how to handle it and redirect to your own error page with your own error messages .
we ’ve also added refresh token support when using your custom authentication provider through a named credential .
you can now add custom code to handle the refresh .
health check : import custom baselines and assign new permissions we ’ve introduced new permissions for health check , as well as the ability to import custom baselines into the tool .
in
this section : import a custom security baseline into health check ( beta ) you can now customize the health check security baseline to compare your org ’s security settings with your industry standards .
this feature is new in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
new permission required for viewing and managing health check you now must have view health check permission to view your health check score , and view and edit health check settings .
you must have the manage health check permissions create , edit , and delete custom baselines in health check .
admins are granted this permission by default .
when you enable the manage health check permission , the view heath check permissions is also enabled .
this change applies to both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
import a custom security baseline into health check ( beta ) you can now customize the health check security baseline to compare your org ’s security settings with your industry standards .
this feature is new in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
this release contains a beta version of custom baseline , which means it ’s a high - quality feature with known limitations .
general availability , with complete documentation and support , is planned for a subsequent release .
you create a custom baseline by exporting an existing baseline , like the salesforce baseline standard , modifying and saving the xml file , and importing it back into health check .
from setup , enter health check  in the quick find  box , then select health check .
editions available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions ( 1 ) select either the salesforce baseline standard or a custom baseline .
( 2 ) choose to export or import an xml file , or delete a custom baseline .

encryption checks go faster when you encrypt fields or files , salesforce checks that everything you ’ve specified can be encrypted .
we ’ve optimized the validation process for speed and accuracy .
some setup combinations can make it impossible to encrypt some data .
for example , if you have sosl queries that reference a field , then that field ca n’t be encrypted .
the validation service detects those situations and suggests ways to work around them .
some of the potential limitations are easy to detect .
we now test for those right when you set up your encryption preferences , so that the encryption can take place quickly .
other situations are more complex .
those tests now run asynchronously , so they do n’t hold up the encryption process , and you get the results in an email .
for example , we ’ll let you know right away if you ca n’t encrypt fields because you have a portal enabled .
however , checking whether a formula works with an encrypted field might take longer .

salesforce help : encrypt data in chatter ( pilot ) turn off masking for encrypted data data masking is being decoupled from shield platform encryption .
the “ view encrypted data ” permission and its resulting masking behavior will no longer be available in shield platform encryption when you activate this critical update .
field - level and object - level security features control who has access to data , regardless of whether it is encrypted .
with this change : • you get a more consistent experience for users when they access encrypted data • you reduce confusion between data that ’s masked and data that ’s encrypted .
they are n’t the same thing .
the “ view encrypted data ” permission still applies to classic encryption .
encrypt search index files with a dedicated tenant secret type
sometimes it ’s smart to apply different key rotation cycles or destruction policies to keys that encrypt different types of data .
shield platform encryption now lets you do exactly that , through either the setup page or the api .
you can apply a tenant secret to all data stored in salesforce or just to your search index files .
from then on , that tenant secret only encrypts the data in that specific category .
choose which kind of data you want to encrypt from the dropdown menu , and then generate or upload your tenant secret .
you can have one active tenant secret per data type , and view all active , exported , and archived tenant secrets by type .
as in the past , you can track these tenant secrets in the setup audit trail .
to support this via the api , we ’ve added the type  restricted picklist to the tenantsecret object , with two values : • data —
a tenant secret that encrypts data stored in the salesforce database . includes data in files , fields , and attachments , but not search index files . •
searchindex — a tenant secret that encrypts search index files .

• lightning error —
errors that occurred during user interactions with the lightning experience ui , such as a user receives an aura error on a page in the app .
editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions • lightning interaction — user interactions with the lightning experience ui , such as a user clicks in the navigation header or a task list
. • lightning page view — information about the page on which the event occurred in the lightning experience ui , such as the effective page time and the page entities that the user interacted with . •
lightning performance —
data to spot trends in your lightning experience app performance , such as page start times and duration . 419 salesforce spring release notes salesforce shield : more event log data ,
dedicated encryption keys example :  you want to research how your reps use the tasks page in your app to customize it to their needs .
you use the data in the lightning page view event type to review how reps get to the page , how long they stay , and the page entities they interact with .
you drill down into your users’ interactions with tasks page elements , like the task list and lightning navigation header , by reviewing the lightning interaction event type data .

now you can use login as event type data to review those actions to identify any security breaches or vulnerabilities , and also to inform your users what occurred .
editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions we added the following fields to the loginas event type in the eventlogfile object .
you can use login_key and session_key together to uniquely identify a user ’s session to show salesforce administrators’ click paths through your app while they were logged in as another user .
many other event types also include login_key and session_key , giving you a complete picture of a user ’s activity across your org .
• cpu_time  — the cpu time in milliseconds used to complete the request .
this field indicates the amount of activity taking place in the app server layer , highlighting pieces of apex or visualforce code that need refactoring . •
login_key  — the string that ties together all events in a given user ’s login session .
it starts with a login event and ends with either a logout event or the user session expiring . •
run_time
— the amount of time that the request took in milliseconds . • session_key
— the string that ties together all events for a particular activity session .
for example , uri events while the user is interacting with an accounts page .
• uri_id_derived  — the 18-character case insensitive id of the uri of the page that ’s receiving the request .
example :  your org ’s security officer performed an audit to find out who updated records containing sensitive information on tuesday .
the security officer identifies a sales rep who changed the records .
however , the sales rep insists that she did n’t modify the records on tuesday .
to investigate further , you use login as event data along with uri event data to narrow down ( based on 420
salesforce spring release notes other security changes : browser security and new session settings login_key and session_key ) who really modified the records .
you determine that an admin who logged in on behalf of the sales rep updated the records on tuesday .

server - side access checks for events it ’s easier to find access check failures for events .
previously , only client - side access check failures were enforced and resulted in a partially functional component .
depending on the code and how you tested it , the failure could be easy to miss .
now , if a component references an event for which it does n’t have access , additional server - side access checks result in the component failing to load .
new lightning lockerservice informational setup page lockerservice enhances security by isolating individual lightning components in their own namespace .
lockerservice also promotes best practices that improve the supportability of your code by only allowing access to supported apis and eliminating access to non - published framework internals .
the new setup page describes the lockerservice critical update and provides links to more information .
the page increases visibility for this important critical update .
the page is purely informational and does n't include any settings .
banner reminds you
about lockerservice the new banner in lightning experience informs salesforce admins and developers about the enforcement of the lockerservice critical update scheduled for june 13 , 2017 .
you can dismiss the banner , but it will reappear once a month during the spring release .
lockerservice has stricter content security policy the existing lockerservice critical update tightens content security policy ( csp ) to eliminate the possibility of cross - site scripting attacks .
these csp changes are enforced only in sandboxes and developer edition orgs .

salesforce lightning cli is no longer noisy by default
the default output now only shows errors so you can focus on bigger issues .
previously , the default output showed errors and warnings .
to see warnings too , use the new --verbose argument .
use unbound expressions for one - way data binding between components use the { # expression }  syntax for unbound expressions when you pass an expression from a parent component to a child component , unless you require bidirectional data binding .
bound expressions with { ! expression }  create a bidirectional data binding that ’s expensive for performance .
bound expressions can also create hard - to - debug errors due to the propagation of data changes through nested components .
speed up your components by fixing performance warnings a few common performance anti - patterns in code prompt the framework to log warning messages to the browser console .
fix the warning messages to speed up your components !
debug lightning components on every page with salesforce lightning inspector get component information from every lightning page in your app , show components that initiated actions , and debug components running on lightning out .
customize the look and feel of lightning apps by overriding tokens ( developer preview ) easily redefine standard tokens with your own token values to tailor your lightning apps .
share lightning apps with non - authenticated users add the ltng : allowguestaccess interface to your lightning out dependency app to make it available to users without requiring them to authenticate with salesforce .
this interface lets you build your app with lightning components , and deploy it anywhere and to anyone .
find component markup errors faster with improved error messages we ’ve improved the details provided and the presentation of run - time errors caused by certain kinds of lightning component markup errors .
it ’s now easier for your users to report errors they encounter , and for you to find and fix those errors .
this change affects all users of your org , and does n’t depend on debug mode being enabled . create lightning components for quick actions in the developer console the new lightning bundle panel in the developer console now includes an option to add the interface for a lightning quick action when you create a lightning component bundle .
lightning data service ( developer preview ) lightning data service continues to be available in developer preview , with updated documentation to help you get started .
use lightning data service to load , create , edit , or delete a record in your component , without requiring apex code .
lightning data service handles sharing rules and field level security for you .
in addition to not needing apex , lightning data service improves performance and user interface consistency .
simplified event handling across base lightning components take the guesswork out of event handling and go straight to the source .
base lightning components now let you access the component firing the event using event.getsource ( )  with or without lockerservice .
removed lockerservice restriction on instanceof in javascript
previously , we advised against using the instanceof  operator in javascript code when lockerservice is activated .
this restriction has been removed due to some framework refactoring .
deprecated useappcache attribute in < aura : application > browser vendors have deprecated appcache so we ’ve followed their lead .
remove the useappcache attribute in the < aura : application >  tag of your standalone apps ( .app resources ) to avoid cross - browser support issues due to deprecation by browser vendors .
new and changed lightning components we added several new components and made improvements to others so that you can create apps faster .

use lightning : container  to use third - party frameworks like angularjs or react within your lightning pages .
note :  the lightning : container component is available as a developer preview .
this feature is available in developer edition orgs only .
lightning : container  is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
all commands , parameters , and other features are subject to change or deprecation at any time , with or without notice
. do n’t implement functionality developed with these commands or tools .
the lightning : container  component hosts the content in an iframe .
you can use lightning : container  only for single - page applications .
you can implement communication to and from the framed application , allowing it to interact with the lightning component .
lightning : container  provides the message ( )  method , which you can use in the javascript controller to send messages to the application .
in the component , specify a method for handling messages with the onmessage  attribute .
this example loads a third - party app developed with react , myreactapp , which is uploaded as a static resource .
the app is a single - page application , with the landing page index.html , and takes two attributes , messagetosend  and messagereceived .
these attributes store the value of the message to send and receive .
the handlemessage  method specified by the onmessage  attribute handles these attributes in the component ’s controller .
< aura : component implements="flexipage : availableforallpagetypes " > < aura : attribute name="messagetosend " type="string"/ > < aura : attribute name="messagereceived " type="string"/ > < lightning : container src="{!$resource.myreactapp + ' /index.html ' } " onmessage="{!c.handlemessage}"/ > < /aura : component > lightning : container  has known limitations .
you might observe performance and scrolling issues associated with the use of iframes .
this component is not designed for the multi - page model , and it does n’t integrate with browser navigation history .
for now , content in lightning : container  is being served from the visualforce domain .
lightning : container  ca n’t be used in lightning pages that are n’t served from the lightning domain , such as visualforce pages or community builder .
these restrictions allow lightning : container  to comply with lockerservice security , and might change in future releases .

426 salesforce spring release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach the lightning : inputrichtext  component creates a rich - text editor based on the quill js library , enabling you to add , edit , format , and delete rich text .
pasting rich content into the editor is supported if the feature is available in the toolbar .
for example , you can paste bold text if the bold button is available in the toolbar .
the toolbar displays the font family and size menu , the format text block with bold , italic , underline , and strikethrough buttons .
it also displays the format body block with bulleted list , numbered list , indent , and outdent buttons , followed by the align text block with left align text , center align text , and right align text buttons .
the remove formatting button is at the end of the toolbar .
example :  display user input that ’s entered into the rich - text editor using the ui : outputrichtext component .
< aura : component > < aura : attribute name="myval " type="string " default="&lt;b > hello&lt;/b>"/ > < lightning : inputrichtext value="{!v.myval } " placeholder="type something interesting " > < /lightning : inputrichtext > < div aura : id="output " class="slds - box slds - text - longform " > < ui : outputrichtext value="{!v.myval } " / > < /div >
< /aura : component > beta limitations this release of lightning : inputrichtext  contains some known limitations . •
the editor does n’t display correctly in narrow views , typically less than 300 pixels in width . •
the font and size menus are n’t accessible to screen readers and are likely to change in future releases . •
the font and size menus do n’t close if you click outside the menus without making a selection .
click the menu again to close it .
server - side access checks for events it ’s easier to find access check failures for events .
previously , only client - side access check failures were enforced and resulted in a partially functional component .
depending on the code and how you tested it , the failure could be easy to miss .
now , if a component references an event for which it does n’t have access , additional server - side access checks result in the component failing to load .
if a component references an event that does n’t have an access  system attribute allowing the component to access the event : • client - side code does n’t execute or returns undefined .
if you enabled debug mode , you see an error message in your browser console .
• server - side code results in the component failing to load .
if you enabled debug mode , you see a popup error message .
for more information about the access  system attribute , see the lightning components developer guide . 427 salesforce spring release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach new lightning lockerservice informational setup page lockerservice enhances security by isolating individual lightning components in their own namespace .
lockerservice also promotes best practices that improve the supportability of your code by only allowing access to supported apis and eliminating access to non - published framework internals .
the new setup page describes the lockerservice critical update and provides links to more information .
the page increases visibility for this important critical update .
the page is purely informational and does n't include any settings . 1 .
from setup , enter lockerservice  in the quick find  box . 2 .
select lightning lockerservice .
lockerservice remains a critical update for spring .
lockerservice will be automatically activated for all orgs in the summer release .
before the summer release , you can manually activate and deactivate the update as often as you need to evaluate the impact on your org .
what does lockerservice affect ?
lockerservice enforces security in : • lightning experience •
salesforce1 • template - based communities • standalone apps that you create ( for example , myapp.app ) lockerservice enforces security in lightning out .
however , the csp restrictions of lockerservice are n’t enforced in lightning out .
lightning out allows you to run lightning components in a container outside of lightning apps , such as lightning components in visualforce and visualforce - based communities .
the container defines the csp rules .
lockerservice does n’t affect salesforce classic , visualforce - based communities , sales console , or service console , except for usage of lightning components in visualforce in these contexts .
graceful degradation for unsupported browsers lockerservice relies on some basic javascript features in the browser : support for strict mode and the map object .
these requirements align with the supported browsers for lightning experience .
if a browser does n’t meet the requirements , lockerservice ca n’t enforce all its security features .
we ’ve improved the user experience for unsupported browsers .
however , if you use an unsupported browser , you ’re likely to encounter issues that wo n’t be fixed .
make your life easier and your browsing experience more secure by using a supported browser .
note :  ie11 does n’t support csp , so we recommend using other supported browsers for enhanced security .

these csp changes are enforced only in sandboxes and developer edition orgs .
the csp changes have no effect in production orgs , even when lockerservice is activated .
the lightning component framework uses content security policy ( csp ) to control the source of content that can be loaded on a page .
this change enables you to test lockerservice in its entirety before the critical update is activated for all orgs in summer .
lockerservice remains a critical update for spring .
lockerservice will be automatically activated for all orgs in the summer release .
before the summer release , you can manually activate and deactivate the update as often as you need to evaluate the impact on your org .
we recommend that you test lockerservice in a sandbox or developer edition org to verify the behavior of your components before enabling it in your production org .
in spring , lockerservice now disallows the unsafe - inline and unsafe - eval csp keywords for inline scripts ( script - src ) .
ensure that your code and third - party libraries you use adhere to these rules by removing all calls using eval ( )  or inline javascript code execution .
you might have to update your third - party libraries to modern versions that do n’t depend on unsafe - inline  or unsafe - eval .
these csp changes are enforced only in sandboxes and developer edition orgs .
note : • when lockerservice is activated in sandboxes or developer edition orgs , you ca n't edit rich - text fields , and the fields are grayed out .
rest assured that the limitation is only temporary for spring .
we ’re removing this limitation before lockerservice is activated for all orgs in summer .

ie11 does n’t support csp , so we recommend using other supported browsers for enhanced security .
csp is a candidate recommendation of the w3c working group on web application security .
the framework uses the content- security - policy  http header recommended by the w3c. the csp changes in spring are in addition to the existing security features in the lockerservice critical update in winter .

salesforce help : supported browsers for lightning experience ( can be outdated or unavailable during release preview ) 429 salesforce spring release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach create csp trusted sites to access third - party apis the lightning component framework uses content security policy ( csp ) to control the source of content that can be loaded on a page .
to use third - party apis that make requests to an external ( non - salesforce ) server , add the server as a csp trusted site .
csp is a candidate recommendation of the w3c working group on web application security .
the framework uses the content- security - policy  http header recommended by the w3c. by default , the framework ’s headers allow content to be loaded only from secure ( https ) urls and forbid xhr requests from javascript .
when you define a csp trusted site , the site ’s url is added to the list of allowed sites for the following directives in the csp header . • connect - src • frame - src • img - src • style - src • font - src • media - src this change to the csp header directives allows lightning components to load resources , such as images , styles , and fonts , from the site .
it also allows client - side code to make requests to the site .
important :  you ca n’t load javascript resources from a third - party site , even a csp trusted site .
to use a javascript library from a third - party site , add it to a static resource , and then add the static resource to your component .
after the library is loaded from the static resource , you can use it as normal .
note : csp trusted sites affect the csp header only for lightning component framework requests .
to enable corresponding access for visualforce or apex , create a remote site .
csp is n’t enforced by all browsers .
for a list of browsers that enforce csp , see caniuse.com .
ie11 does n’t support csp , so we recommend using other supported browsers for enhanced security .

by default the default output now only shows errors so you can focus on bigger issues .
previously , the default output showed errors and warnings .
to see warnings too , use the new --verbose argument .
lightning cli is a heroku toolbelt plugin that lets you scan your code for general javascript coding issues and lightning - specific issues .
this tool is useful for preparing your lightning components code for lockerservice enablement .
the --quiet  flag has been removed as it matches the default behavior of ignoring warning messages .
for more information about the salesforce lightning cli , see the lightning components developer guide .
use unbound expressions for one - way data binding between components use the { # expression }  syntax for unbound expressions when you pass an expression from a parent component to a child component , unless you require bidirectional data binding .
bound expressions with { ! expression }  create a bidirectional data binding that ’s expensive for performance .
bound expressions can also create hard - to - debug errors due to the propagation of data changes through nested components .
430 salesforce spring release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach this concept is a little tricky , but it will make more sense when we look at an example .
consider a c : parent  component that has a parentattr  attribute .
c : parent contains a c : child  component with a childattr  attribute that ’s initialized to the value of the parentattr  attribute .
we ’re passing the parentattr  attribute value from c : parent  into the c : child  component , which results in a data binding , also known as a value binding , between the two components .
< !
--c : parent-- > < aura : component > < aura : attribute name="parentattr " type="string " default="parent attribute"/ > < ! -- instantiate the child component -- > < c : child childattr="{!v.parentattr } " / > < /aura : component > { ! v.parentattr }  is a bound expression .
any change to the value of the childattr attribute in c : child  also affects the parentattr  attribute in c : parent  and vice versa .
now , let ’s change the markup from : < c : child childattr="{!v.parentattr } " / > to : < c : child childattr="{#v.parentattr } " / > { # v.parentattr }  is an unbound expression .
any change to the value of the childattr attribute in c : child  does n’t affect the parentattr  attribute in c : parent  and vice versa .
here ’s a summary of the differences between the forms of expression syntax .
{ # expression }  ( unbound expressions ) data updates behave as you would expect in javascript .
primitives , such as string , are passed by value , and data updates for the expression in the parent and child are decoupled .
objects , such as array  or map , are passed by reference , so changes to the data in the child propagate to the parent .
however , change handlers in the parent are n’t notified .
the same behavior applies for changes in the parent propagating to the child . { !
expression }  ( bound expressions ) data updates in either component are reflected through bidirectional data binding in both components .
similarly , change handlers are triggered in both the parent and child components .
speed up your components by fixing performance warnings a few common performance anti - patterns in code prompt the framework to log warning messages to the browser console .
fix the warning messages to speed up your components !
the warnings display in the browser console only if you enabled debug mode .
< aura : if>—clean unrendered body
this warning occurs when you change the istrue  attribute of an < aura : if > tag from true  to false  in the same rendering cycle .
the unrendered body of the < aura : if >  must be destroyed , which is avoidable work for the framework that slows down rendering time .
< aura : iteration>—multiple items set this warning occurs when you set the items  attribute of an < aura : iteration >  tag multiple times in the same rendering cycle .
for more information about fixing the performance warnings , see the lightning components developer guide .

432 salesforce spring release notes lightning out support lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach if your app uses lightning out to run lightning components , you can use salesforce lightning inspector to debug your components . customize the look and feel of lightning apps by overriding tokens ( developer preview ) easily redefine standard tokens with your own token values to tailor your lightning apps .
note :  overriding standard tokens is available as a developer preview .
this feature is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
you can provide feedback and suggestions for this feature on the ideaexchange .
to override a standard token for your lightning app , create a tokens bundle with a unique name , for example myoverrides .
in the tokens resource , redefine the value for a standard token : < aura : tokens > < aura : token name="colortextbrand " value="#8d7d74"/ > < /aura : tokens > in your lightning app , specify the tokens bundle in the tokens attribute : < aura : application tokens="c : myoverrides " > < ! --
your app markup here -- > < /aura : application > token overrides apply across your app , including resources and components provided by salesforce and components of your own that use tokens .
packaging apps that use the tokens attribute is unsupported .
important :  overriding standard token values within defaulttokens.tokens , a required resource in a tokens bundle , is unsupported .
if you create a token with the same name as a standard token , it overrides the standard token ’s value in some contexts , and has no effect in others .
overrides should only be done in a separate resource as described above .
share lightning apps with non - authenticated users add the ltng : allowguestaccess interface to your lightning out dependency app to make it available to users without requiring them to authenticate with salesforce .
this interface lets you build your app with lightning components , and deploy it anywhere and to anyone .
a lightning out dependency app with the ltng : allowguestaccess  interface can be used with lightning components for visualforce and with lightning out . •
using lightning components for visualforce , you can add your lightning app to a visualforce page , and then use that page in salesforce tabs + visualforce communities .
then you can allow public access to that page . •
using lightning out , you can deploy your lightning app anywhere lightning out is supported — which is almost anywhere !
the ltng : allowguestaccess  interface is only usable in orgs that have communities enabled , and your lightning out app is associated with all community endpoints that you ’ve defined in your org .
important :  when you make a lightning app accessible to guest users by adding the ltng : allowguestaccess  interface , it ’s available through every community in your org , whether that community is enabled for public access or not .
you ca n’t prevent it from being accessible via community urls , and you ca n’t make it available for some communities but not others . 433 salesforce spring release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach warning :  be extremely careful about apps you open for guest access .
apps enabled for guest access bypass the object- and field - level security ( fls ) you set for your community ’s guest user profile .
lightning components do n’t automatically enforce crud and fls when you reference objects or retrieve the objects from an apex controller .
this means that the framework continues to display records and fields for which users do n’t have crud access and fls visibility .
you must manually enforce crud and fls in your apex controllers .
a mistake in code used in an app enabled for guest access can open your org ’s data to the world .
usage to begin with , add the ltng : allowguestaccess  interface to your lightning out dependency app .
for example : < aura : application access="global " extends="ltng : outapp " implements="ltng : allowguestaccess " > < aura : dependency resource="c : storelocatormain"/ > < /aura : application > note :  you can only add the ltng : allowguestaccess  interface to lightning apps , not to individual components .
next , add the lightning out javascript library to your page . •
with lightning components for visualforce , simply add the < apex : includelightning / >  tag anywhere on your page . •
with lightning out , add a < script >  tag that references the library directly , using a community endpoint url .
for example : < script src="https://yourcommunitydomain / communityurl / lightning / lightning.out.js"></script > for example , https://universalcontainers.force.com/ourstores/lightning/lightning.out.js finally , add the javascript code to load and activate your lightning app .
this code is standard lightning out , with the important addition that you must use one of your org ’s community urls for the endpoint .
the endpoint url takes the form https://yourcommunitydomain / communityurl/. the relevant line is emphasized in the following sample .
< script > $ lightning.use("c : locatorapp " , function ( ) { // name of the lightning app //
callback once framework and app loaded $ lightning.createcomponent ( " c : storelocatormain " , // top - level component of your app { } , " lightninglocator " , function(cmp ) { // attributes to set on the component when created // the dom location to insert the component //
callback when component is created and active on the page } ) ; } , ' https://universalcontainers.force.com/ourstores/ ' //

it ’s now easier for your users to report errors they encounter , and for you to find and fix those errors .
this change affects all users of your org , and does n’t depend on debug mode being enabled .
because a picture is worth a thousand words , here are two of them .
spring error message
previous release note :  the new error panel does n’t have an ok button .
to dismiss the panel , click the “ x ” in the top right .
the new error panel appears only when a relevant error occurs in lightning experience or salesforce1 .
the error panel ’s expandable stack trace appears only on desktop and tablet form factors — not on a phone .
only certain kinds of markup errors result in the new error reporting .
errors in your component controller or helper javascript code display with the old error output .
the new error reporting affects only your custom components , not standard components provided 435 salesforce spring release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach with the framework .
outside of lightning experience and salesforce1 , for example , in lightning out or a standalone app , error output can include details that were previously omitted , such as a complete stack trace .
create lightning components for quick actions in the developer console the new lightning bundle panel in the developer console now includes an option to add the interface for a lightning quick action when you create a lightning component bundle .
the lightning quick action option adds the force : lightningquickaction  interface to the new component as a value on the component ’s implements  attribute .
if you ’re creating a quick action with a completely custom user interface , edit the resulting markup to use the force : lightningquickactionwithoutheader interface instead .
see also : lightning components developer guide : configure components for custom actions lightning components developer guide : lightning bundle configurations available in the developer console lightning data service ( developer preview ) lightning data service continues to be available in developer preview , with updated documentation to help you get started .
use lightning data service to load , create , edit , or delete a record in your component , without requiring apex code .
lightning data service handles sharing rules and field level security for you .
in addition to not needing apex , lightning data service improves performance and user interface consistency .
436 salesforce spring release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach simplified event handling across base lightning components take the guesswork out of event handling and go straight to the source .
base lightning components now let you access the component firing the event using event.getsource ( )  with or without lockerservice .
event.getsource ( )  returns an instance of the component that fires the event .
for example : < aura : component > < lightning : button name="mybutton " onclick="{!c.dosomething}"/ > < /aura : component > ( { dosomething : function(cmp , event , helper ) { var button = event.getsource ( ) ; //the following patterns are not supported //when you ’re trying to access another component ’s //dom elements .
var el = event.target ; var currentel = event.currenttarget ; } } ) retrieve a component attribute that ’s passed to the event by using this syntax .
event.getsource().get("v.name " ) note :
in summer ' 17 , lockerservice will be automatically enabled for all orgs .
in anticipation of this change , we recommend that you update your javascript code to use event.getsource ( ) .
this pattern is consistent with event handling in other components , such as those in the ui  namespace .
in
this section : handling the onactive event get a reference to the active component when a lightning : tab  or lightning : menuitem component is active .
see also :
lockerservice has stricter content security policy handling the onactive event get a reference to the active component when a lightning : tab  or lightning : menuitem component is active .
with the onactive  event handler , you know which tab or menu item is active .
clicking the component multiple times invokes the handler once only .
for example , you can lazy load the tab ’s content only when it ’s active .
here 's an example with two tabs , which loads content when they 're active .
< lightning : tabset variant="scoped " > < lightning : tab onactive= " { ! c.handleactive } " label="accounts " id="accounts " / > < lightning : tab onactive= " { !
c.handleactive } " label="cases " id="cases " / > < /lightning : tabset > 437 salesforce spring release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach in your client - side helper , pass the tab that 's selected before adding your content using $ a.createcomponent ( ) .
( { handleactive : function ( cmp , event ) { var tab = event.getsource ( ) ; switch ( tab.get('v.id ' ) ) { case ' accounts ' : case ' cases ' : this.injectcomponent('c:myaccountcomponent ' , tab ) ; break ; this.injectcomponent('c:mycasecomponent ' , tab ) ; break ; } } , injectcomponent : function ( name , target ) { $ a.createcomponent(name , { } , function ( contentcomponent , status , error ) { if ( status = = = " success " ) { target.set('v.body ' , contentcomponent ) ; } else { throw new error(error ) ; } } ) ; } } ) note :  if you only need the id or value of the tab and you do n’t need a reference to the target component , use the onselect event handler .
removed lockerservice restriction on instanceof in javascript
previously , we advised against using the instanceof  operator in javascript code when lockerservice is activated .
this restriction has been removed due to some framework refactoring .
feel free to use instanceof  in your components or upload static resources for third - party libraries that use instanceof  in their internals .
deprecated useappcache attribute in < aura : application > browser vendors have deprecated appcache so we ’ve followed their lead .
remove the useappcache attribute in the < aura : application >  tag of your standalone apps ( .app resources ) to avoid cross - browser support issues due to deprecation by browser vendors .
if you do n’t currently set useappcache  in an < aura : application >  tag , you do n't have to do anything as the default value of useappcache  is false .

to use lightning design system stylesheets in your visualforce page , add < apex : slds / >  anywhere in your page markup .
in general , the lightning design system is already scoped .
however , if you set applybodytag  or applyhtmltag  to false , you must include the scoping class slds - scope .
within the scoping class , your markup can reference lightning design system styles and assets .
to reference assets in the lightning design system , such as svg icons and images , use the urlfor ( )  formula function and the $ asset  global variable .
see also :
reference lightning design system assets with the $ asset global variable visualforce developer guide : using the lightning design system reference lightning design system assets with the $ asset global variable use the $ asset  global variable to access images , sprites , and other assets that are part of the lightning design system .
use it in visualforce pages that also use the < apex : slds >  component .
use $ asset  instead of $ resource .
the variable takes dot notation and slds .
for example , this markup references a jpg avatar in the lightning design system .
< apex : page > < apex : slds / > < span class="slds - icon_container slds - icon -- small slds - icon - standard - account " title="contact avatar " > < img src="{!urlfor($asset
. slds , ' assets / images / avatar1.jpg ' ) } " alt="contact avatar " / > < /span
> < /apex : page > see also : use the lightning design system in visualforce pages visualforce developer guide : $ asset add more security to your visualforce pages we added a login setting that enables access to force.com site standard pages .
if your site serves only visualforce pages , then disabling this setting adds a layer of access protection to your site . 442 salesforce spring release notes visualforce : enhanced for lightning experience
from setup , enter sites  in the quick find  box , then select sites .
click the site name , and in the site details page , click login settings .
standard pages are provided by salesforce as a part of the platform , as opposed to visualforce pages that you create .
when enabled , the allow access to standard salesforce pages setting allows authenticated users to access standard salesforce pages in the site as allowed by their access controls .
when disabled , authenticated users ca n't access standard salesforce pages , even if their access controls allow it .
note :  the setting is only visible in non - community force.com sites .
however , you can use this setting with a community ’s force.com site through the metadata api .
allow csrf protection on get requests to visualforce pages ( critical update )
this critical update makes it possible to enable csrf checks for get requests on visualforce pages , and might break links to existing visualforce pages .
when creating a visualforce page in setup , you can select require csrf protection on get requests .
this option adds an extra layer of security to your visualforce page that guards against cross - site request forgery ( csrf ) .
this critical update gives you the option of enabling csrf protection on visualforce pages , but it does not automatically enable protection on every page .
previously , this option only had an effect when applied to visualforce pages used for delete action overrides .
in general , a post request from a visualforce page submits data , while a get request asks for data .
post requests always have csrf protection .
this critical update gives you the option of ensuring that visualforce pages receive a csrf token with a get request .
when this option is enabled for a visualforce page , you ca n’t access the page by entering its url—/apex / pagename .
also , plain links to that page using < a >  tags do n’t work .
if you try to access a visualforce page with csrf protection enabled , the page does n’t load and you get an error . 443 salesforce spring release notes visualforce : enhanced for lightning experience plain links from a page with csrf checks work , but links to the page do not .
for example , if your page has the name pagename , the link < a href=" / apex / pagename" > link</a >  does n’t work .
instead , use the urlfor ( )  formula function , the $ page global variable , or the apex : outputlink  component .
< apex : outputlink value=" / apex / pagename" > link using apex : outputlink</apex : outputlink > < a href="{!$page .
pagename}" > link using $ page</a > < a href="{!urlfor($page .
pagename)}" > link using urlfor()</a > csrf checks on get requests also affect how visualforce pages are referenced from apex controllers .
methods that return the url of csrf - protected pages for navigation do n’t work : public string getpage ( ) { return ' /apex / pagename ' ; } } instead , use methods that return a reference to the visualforce page instead of the url directly .
public class customcontroller { public pagereference getpage ( ) { return new pagereference('/apex / pagename ' ) ; public pagereference getpage1 ( ) { return page .
pagename ; } } when you use one of these methods to link to a page , visualforce adds the required csrf token to the url .
these are the preferred methods for linking to visualforce pages , regardless of whether csrf protection is enabled for the page .
you can use only these methods to add a csrf token to a url for a visualforce page .
test this critical update this update is enabled everywhere on the auto - activation date , june 11 , 2017 .
we recommend that you test your visualforce code in a developer edition org before then and verify that links to all your visualforce pages using csrf protection still work .
if you must work in your production org , do so during off - peak hours . 1 .
from setup , enter critical updates  in the quick find  box , and then select critical updates . 2 .
for “
allow csrf protection on get requests to visualforce pages ” , click activate .
3 . test links to any visualforce pages that have csrf protection on get requests enabled .
new order of visualforce url parameters affects overrides changes to the order of visualforce page url parameters can affect your visualforce overrides .
if you use a visualforce page to override an action without encoding the parameter ’s value , your users encounter an error when trying to take that action .
when a user takes an action , such as creating , saving , editing , or deleting a record , the url of the page includes a returl  string .
the returl  tells salesforce which page to return to when the action is completed .
when you are adding the returl  to a url in a visualforce page or apex controller , you must encode it .
otherwise , you could encounter validation errors because we changed the order of returl  and other parameters , such as the record id , in visualforce urls .
in a visualforce page , use urlencode ( ) .
for example , construct the returl  using returl={!urlencode($currentpage.parameters.returl)}. in an apex controller , use the urlencode ( )  method .
for example , encodingutil.urlencode(returl,'utf-8 ' ) . 444 salesforce spring release notes apex code apex code the apex stub api is now generally available .
we ’ve added a page to help you monitor apex batch jobs , and we ’ve fixed some bugs with the instanceof  keyword and test setup methods .
for more information on these enhancements , refer to the apex developer guide .
in
this section : editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , developer , and database.com editions apex stub api is now generally available apex provides a stub api for implementing a mocking framework .
a mocking framework has many benefits .
it can streamline and improve testing and help you create faster , more reliable tests .
you can use it to test classes in isolation , which is important for unit testing .
building your mocking framework with the stub api can also be beneficial because stub objects are generated at runtime .
because these objects are generated dynamically , you do n’t have to package and deploy test classes .
you can use the stub api to build your own mocking framework , or you can use one built by someone else .
monitor the status of apex batch jobs get more information about the status of apex batch jobs .
for a particular batch class , you can get information about parent jobs , such as submitted and completion dates and the number of batches processed or failed .
this change applies to both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
only one test setup method per class is allowed you can now have only one test setup method per apex test class .
a test setup method is a method annotated with @testsetup .
in previous versions , multiple test setup methods were allowed due to a bug , which has now been fixed .
if you run apex test classes that have more than one test setup method , you get a compile - time exception .
update your code and rerun the tests .
goodbye to instanceof keyword bugs the apex instanceof  keyword works more consistently with managed base packages .
in previous versions , it did n’t give the correct value if the expression on the left side was an apex class that extended the target type specified in the expression on the right side , and the apex class was declared in a different package from the target type .
make web service callouts from chained queueable jobs apex now allows web service callouts from chained queueable jobs .
previously , a queueable job could make a web service callout , but additional chained jobs that made callouts would throw exceptions .
maps of populated sobject fields return correct values the sobject.getpopulatedfieldsasmap ( )  method returns a map of populated field names and their corresponding values .
the map contains only the fields that have been populated in memory for the sobject instance .
previously , the method did n’t return fields that were added to an sobject after it had been retrieved via a soql query .
this bug has been fixed , and the method returns the correct fields .
apex has new transaction security policy testing requirements if you ’re using the policy condition interface in the org where the policy was implemented , test classes for the policy are not required .
if you move the policy to another org , you must have test classes for the apex policy in the new org .
testing is required whether the policy is moved from a sandbox to production , with a change set , or some other way .
why ?
if you ’re making a policy available outside of its development environment , it needs testing to make sure it works correctly .

this ga version resolves the following limitations that were present in the pilot version of the stub api . •
when calling the createstub ( )  method in the pilot version , your apex class was required to have a constructor that took zero arguments .

rest api rest api includes changed resources and a generally available resource for making several requests at once .
in
this section : make several requests at once with the composite resource ( generally available ) imagine you ’re writing a mobile app .
to cut down on the number of round trips between your client and salesforce , you want to make several rest api requests in a single call .
you consider the batch resource , but batch does n’t let you pass information between subrequests .
are you out of luck ?
not anymore !
the composite resource lets you make several requests in a single call and provides a way to reference the results of one subrequest in later subrequests .
new resources : flows and flow interviews ( pilot ) have you ever wanted to build your own runtime experience for visual workflow ?
here ’s your chance .
we ’re providing two resources to describe flows and three resources to describe and manipulate interviews .
if you ’re an existing pilot customer , nothing has changed since the last release .
changed resource : search for a string the example response body that includes the metadata  parameter changed .
changed resource : search suggested records
the where  clause now supports specifying multiple objects .
any object - specific where  clause overrides the global where clause .
removed resource : flexipage the flexipage resource has been deprecated in api version 39.0 and has been removed from all previous api versions as well .

lightning api — developer preview use lightning api to create native mobile apps and custom web apps with your own branding and look and feel .
a single rest request returns enough metadata , layout information , and data to display , edit , or create a record !
lightning api supports most objects that are available in lightning experience .
note :  lightning api is available as a developer preview in all de orgs .
to use the api in another type of org , contact salesforce .
editions available in : developer edition get to know lightning api the lightning api base url is https://{your_instance}.salesforce.com / services / data / v{api_version}/lapi .
to get metadata and data to display a record , your code makes a simple rest request to a resource . get /lapi
/ record - ui/001r0000003gej1iak behind the scenes , salesforce does the heavy lifting . • checks field - level security settings , sharing settings , and perms .
• makes soql queries to get record data .
• gets object metadata and theme information .
• gets layout information .
you are one happy developer , because salesforce transforms the results into an easy - to - consume json response with all the information you need to display a record .
tip :
the lightning api developer guide contains a step - by - step quick start to get you up and running .
here 's the quick version of the quick start : open workbench , log in to a de org , and make a request to a lightning api resource !
authorization like other salesforce rest apis , lightning api uses oauth 2.0 .
versioning lightning api is versioned .
specify the api version number in each request .
get https://{your_instance}.salesforce.com / services / data / v39.0/lapi response filtering lightning api is built on the same rest framework as chatter rest api and observes the same filtering rules .
also , several lightning api resources support additional parameters that change the response to include what your ui needs .

for example , formula fields are rendered in view mode , but not in create mode because they ’re calculated at run time , like formulas in a spreadsheet .
– create —
use this mode if you intend to build ui that lets a user create a record .
this mode is used by the /lapi / record - defaults / create/{apiname } resource . –
edit — use this mode if you intend to build ui that lets a user edit a record .
this mode is used by the /lapi / record - defaults / clone/{recordid } resource . –
view—(default ) use this mode if you intend to build ui that displays a record .
error handling the response header contains an http status code .
if the response is n’t successful , the response body contains an error message , and if appropriate , information about the field or object where the error occurred .
rate limiting lightning api requests are subject to rate limiting .
lightning api has a per user , per application , per hour rate limit .
when you exceed the rate limit , all lightning api resources return a 503 service unavailable error code .
required fields when you ’re building ui , to determine which fields to mark as required for create and update , use the objectinfo.fields[].required  property .
resources use the resources in the pilot version of lightning api to display records . • /lapi

bulk api now supports more complex queries bulk queries now support the queryall operation and soql relationships .
the queryall operation the queryall operation returns records that have been deleted because of a merge or delete .
the queryall operation also returns information about archived task and event records .
to make a queryall request , set the operation  field on the jobinfo resource to queryall .
for more information about bulk queries , see use bulk query in the bulk api developer guide .
soql relationships relationship queries traverse parent - to - child and child - to - parent relationships between objects to filter and return results .
you can now use soql relationships in bulk queries .
for more information about soql relationships , see using relationship queries in the force.com soql and sosl reference .
introducing bulk api 2.0 ( pilot ) bulk api 2.0 provides a simple interface for quickly loading large amounts of data into your salesforce org .
492 salesforce spring release notes api note :  we provide bulk api 2.0 to selected customers through a pilot program that requires agreement to specific terms and conditions .
bulk api 2.0 is subject to change and is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
we ca n’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all .
make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available products and features .
bulk api 2.0 includes the following features .
support for oauth 2.0 bulk api 2.0 supports all oauth flows supported by salesforce ’s other rest apis .
automatic file batching bulk api 2.0 simplifies uploading large amounts of data by breaking the files into batches automatically .
all you have to do is upload a csv file with your record data and check back when the results are ready .
daily limits based on number of records instead of limiting the amount of data uploaded daily by the quantity of batches , bulk api 2.0 uses a limit of total records uploaded .
for the pilot , the limit is 1,000,000 records per 24-hour period .
messaging messaging includes enhancements to the beta feature , platform events , and a connector for streaming api and platform events . editions in
this section : deliver customizable events with platform events ( beta ) platform events simplify the process of communicating changes and responding to them without writing complex logic .
publishers and subscribers communicate with each other through events .

this change applies to both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
you can define platform events in salesforce classic only .
available in : performance , unlimited , enterprise , and developer editions
easily subscribe to streaming api in java with emp connector the enterprise messaging platform ( emp ) connector simplifies the process of subscribing to streaming events and platform events in java through cometd. it also supports replaying past events with durable streaming .
no need to write complex logic to implement those functions yourself !
when you use emp connector , call the provided functions to log in and subscribe to a channel .
deliver customizable events with platform events ( beta ) platform events simplify the process of communicating changes and responding to them without writing complex logic .
publishers and subscribers communicate with each other through events .
multiple subscribers can listen to the same event and carry out different actions .
this change applies to both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
you can define platform events in salesforce classic only .
note :  this release contains a beta version of platform events , which means it ’s a high - quality feature with known limitations .
for information on enabling this feature in your org , contact salesforce .
platform events is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
we ca n’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all .
make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available products and features .
you can provide feedback and suggestions for platform events in the success community .
use platform events to deliver secure and scalable custom notifications within salesforce or from external sources .
define fields to customize your platform event .
your custom platform event determines the event data that the force.com platform can produce or consume .
493 salesforce spring release notes api by using platform events , publishers can send customized event data through apex or an api .
subscribers can receive custom notifications from salesforce or an external system and respond with actions using apex or cometd clients .
for example , a software system monitoring a printer can make an api call to publish an event when the ink is low .
the custom printer event can contain custom fields for the printer model , serial number , and ink level .
the event is processed in salesforce by an apex trigger that places an order for a new cartridge .
define your platform event define your platform event on the platform events page in the salesforce user interface .
from setup , enter platform events  in the quick find  box , then select platform events .
platform events are sobjects , similar to custom objects but with some limitations .
event notifications are instances of platform events .
unlike sobjects , you ca n’t update event notifications .
you also ca n’t view them in the user interface .
when you delete platform event definitions , they ’re permanently removed .
platform events ( beta ) improvements in spring platform events ( beta ) was available last release .
in this release , we made the following improvements and changes .
enforcement of event field attributes new platform event records are validated to ensure that the attributes of their custom fields are enforced .
field attributes include the required and default attributes , the precision of number fields , and the maximum length of text fields .
apex testing support you can publish platform events in apex tests and test their associated apex triggers .
trigger number of refires a new class , eventbus .
triggercontext , provides information about the currently executing trigger .
this information includes the number of times the trigger was refired with eventbus .
retryableexception , enabling you to set a limit on the number of refires .
packaging and metadata api support you can add platform events and their associated apex triggers to packages .
platform events are supported in metadata api through the customobject type .
limits new limits are added for platform event publishing , event delivery to cometd clients , and event definitions .
databinding .
objectmapper  no longer supported the transform  methods in the databinding .
objectmapper  class have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release .
to learn more about platform events , see the platform events ( beta ) developer guide .
easily subscribe to streaming api in java with emp connector the enterprise messaging platform ( emp ) connector simplifies the process of subscribing to streaming events and platform events in java through cometd. it also supports replaying past events with durable streaming .
no need to write complex logic to implement those functions yourself !
when you use emp connector , call the provided functions to log in and subscribe to a channel .
emp connector is based on java 8 and uses cometd version 3.0.9 .
the connector supports pushtopic and generic streaming events , as well as platform events .
it also supports username and password authentication and oauth bearer token authentication .
example :  this java example logs in with the specified username and password credentials and performs a handshake with cometd.
next , it subscribes to a pushtopic called mytopic  with the channel name /topic
/ mytopic .
the replay id is initially set to the replay_from_earliest  constant , which means that the subscription returns the oldest saved event ( up to 24 hours ) in addition to new events .
the empconnector  class is the main class that exposes the functions for starting a 494 salesforce spring release notes api connection and subscribing .
event notifications are written to the output through the java lambda expression ( event - > system.out.println ( .. ) ) . //
replay from the start of the event window . //
may be any valid replayfrom position in the event stream .
long replayfrom = empconnector .
replay_from_earliest ; //
get parameters from login bayeuxparameters params = login(" < username > " , " < password > " ) ; //
the event consumer . //
this lambda expression prints the received event to the output // each time a notification is received .
consumer < map < string , object > > consumer = event - > system.out.println ( string.format("received:\n%s " , event ) ) ; // instantiate the emp connector empconnector connector = new empconnector(params ) ; //
wait for handshake with streaming api connector.start().get(5 , timeunit .
seconds ) ; //
subscribe to a topic //
block and wait for the subscription to succeed for 5 seconds topicsubscription subscription = connector.subscribe("/topic/mytopic " , replayfrom , consumer).get(5 , timeunit .
seconds ) ; //
here 's our subscription system.out.println(string.format("subscribed : % s " , subscription ) ) ; to use oauth bearer token authentication instead , replace the bayeuxparameters  value with the following .
the url corresponds to your salesforce instance url .
bayeuxparameters params = new bayeuxparameters ( ) { @override public string bearertoken ( ) { return " < token > " ; } @override public url host ( ) { try { return new url(" < url > " ) ; } catch ( malformedurlexception e ) { throw new illegalargumentexception(string.format("unable to create url : % s " , argv[0 ] ) , e ) ; } } } ;
the following function calls end a subscription . //
cancel a subscription subscription.cancel ( ) ; 495 salesforce spring release notes api //
stop the connector connector.stop ( ) ; for a complete example , see the emp - connector github repository .
and we saved the best for last : emp connector is an open - source project , which means that you can contribute to it with your own enhancements !
feel free to submit your contributions in the emp - connector github repository .

using the indexes tag , you must define which custom bigobject fields make up your composite primary key .
a composite primary key can have up to five fields , and the number of characters from all text fields must not exceed 50 .
the order that the fields are defined within the indexes tag determines the composite primary key order .
all fields included in the composite primary key must be defined in the bigobject and marked as required .
note :  you must use metadata api version 39.0 or later .

you can use a subset of soql commands to query the fields in a composite primary key .
you build a composite primary key query starting from the first field defined in the primary key , without any gaps between the first and last field in the query .
you can use range operations only on the last field queried .
any preceding fields can only use the =  operator .
the following queries assume that lastname__c , firstname__c , and phonenumber__c  define the composite primary key in the table .
this query specifies all three fields in the index .
in this case , the filter on phonenumber__c  can be a range .
select lastname__c , firstname__c , phonenumber__c from phone_book__b where lastname__c='kelly ' and firstname__c='charlie ' and phonenumber__c='2155555555 ' this query specifies only the first two fields in the index .

the predictive vision service is a rest api , so you can call it from any language that supports rest calls .
this curl call passes an image of a tree frog into the pre - built model called generalimageclassifier .

now , field definitions are supported as a type of metadata relationship field .
long text areas in custom metadata types ( pilot ) essential configuration data often runs longer than the 255-character text field limit .
until this release , storing longer strings , such as api keys , specialized markup , or soql queries , required workarounds using text fields .

now , field definitions are supported as a type of metadata relationship field . 506 salesforce spring release notes custom metadata types : relationship field enhancements , long text areas the field definition option is available whenever the custom metadata type has at least one relationship to entity definition . •
the relationship to entity definition is the controlling field . •
the relationship to field definition specifies the standard or custom field from the entity definition object .
on the details page , set the controlling field to the relationship to entity definition .
when adding a record to the custom metadata type that has the relationship fields , select the specific object and field to reference .
for example , select the industry field on the account object .
when creating a view and filter on a field definition relationship field , two separate filters are required — the field definition and the controlling entity definition .
filtering by the field definition relationship field alone is n’t enough .
for example , to view all records that look up the industry field on account , make sure that the filter criteria specify the api names of the object and field .
note these other related changes . •
in the metadata api , metadatarelationshipcontrollingfield  is new . •
in the user interface , the field description for the metadata relationship field type has been expanded to include the entity definition and field definition relationship options .

one changes how visualforce pages implement crsf protection for get requests .
the other decouples the “ view encrypted data ” permission from shield platform encryption .
in addition , the lockerservice , approvals , and flow critical updates from summer ’16 have been postponed .
to ensure a smooth transition , each critical update has an opt - in period , which ends on the auto - activation date that ’s displayed on the critical updates page in setup .
during this period , you can manually activate and deactivate the update as often as you need to evaluate the impact on your org and modify affected customizations .
after the opt - in period has passed , the update is automatically activated .
for more details , see respond to critical updates .
lockerservice has stricter content security policy the existing lockerservice critical update tightens content security policy ( csp ) to eliminate the possibility of cross - site scripting attacks .
these csp changes are enforced only in sandboxes and developer edition orgs .
the csp changes have no effect in production orgs , even when lockerservice is activated .
the lightning component framework uses content security policy ( csp ) to control the source of content that can be loaded on a page .

turn off masking for encrypted data
this critical update decouples masking from the shield platform encryption service .
this means that the “ view encrypted data ”
permission , and its resulting masking behavior , will no longer be available .
customers should review their field and object - level security settings before activating this critical update . “
