saying hello to lightning experience does n’t mean saying goodbye to salesforce classic salesforce classic is still here , and we ’ve made it easy for lightning experience users to move between the old and the new .
so even if lightning experience is n’t a perfect fit yet , you and your users can try it on for size without losing out .
editions
when users are first enabled for lightning experience , the new interface is their default , preferred experience .
ideally , your lightning experience users find that the new interface meets all of their needs .
but if there ’s an important feature or tool back in the classic interface , they can switch to salesforce classic at any time , without assistance from you .
to head back to salesforce classic , use the switcher .
in the lightning experience header , click the profile picture and select switch to salesforce classic .
available in : • group •
professional • • performance • unlimited • developer enterprise
the switcher changes the default preference to salesforce classic .
the user remains in the classic interface until using the switcher to return to lightning experience .
and then the new interface becomes the default preference .
you get the idea .
to find the switcher in salesforce classic , click the name in the upper right corner , then select switch to lightning experience .
56 salesforce winter ’16 release notes is lightning experience right for your salesforce org ?
the fact that your users have the power to move themselves between interfaces will probably shape your decision about when to start using lightning experience .
if lightning experience is missing only a few features that your team uses occasionally , asking users to switch between interfaces can be an acceptable trade - off given the benefits of the new experience .
but it could be best to keep users who need daily access to unsupported sales features , or who work regularly with service features , in salesforce classic — at least for now .

what ’s not available in lightning experience supported editions and user licenses for lightning experience take a look at the supported editions and user licenses to see if your organization can enable and use lightning experience .
note :  person accounts are n’t supported in lightning experience .
if your salesforce implementation uses person accounts , you ca n’t enable lightning experience for your production organization , regardless of your edition .
but to give you an opportunity to try out the new interface , you can enable lightning experience in your sandbox environments .
this option will be available beginning october 24 , 2015 .
and rest assured , adding person account support in the future is a top priority .

we 've worked hard to respect your existing configurations and customizations in lightning experience .
many of your point - and - click and programmatic implementations also work seamlessly in the new interface .
however , some customizations do n’t apply in the new interface or may need to be updated to take advantage of all that lightning experience has to offer .
here are some issues to consider .
navigation menu lightning experience replaces the salesforce classic tab bar with a collapsible navigation menu along the left side of the page .
in this release , customizations made to the tab bar in the classic interface are n’t reflected in the navigation menu .
neither administrators nor users can modify the contents or arrangement of the navigation menu .
but rest assured , we know this is n’t ideal and making the navigation menu customizable in the future is a top priority for us .
use the navigation menu to access the standard salesforce objects that are available in lightning experience , as well as home , chatter items ( the main feed , people , and groups ) , files , dashboards , reports , and the user ’s task list and calendar .
custom objects and apps are also available in lightning experience but access them from the app launcher by clicking in the header .
page layouts and compact layouts record page customizations made in salesforce classic — for custom and standard objects — also affect record pages in lightning experience .
however , some page elements display differently in lightning experience , and some are n’t supported .
compact layouts play the same role in lightning experience that they do for the salesforce1 mobile app : displaying a record ’s key fields in the highlights panel on a record page .
in lightning experience , the highlights panel shows the first five fields from your current compact layouts .
actions and buttons if you ’ve already created and used actions in salesforce classic , you know that they appear in the chatter publisher , while standard and custom buttons appear above the details on a record page .
and if you use salesforce1 , you know that all action types and buttons are 62 salesforce winter ’16 release notes is lightning experience right for your salesforce org ?
co - mingled on the salesforce1 action bar .
in lightning experience , we continue to blur the line between actions and buttons .
but instead of displaying in a single place , actions and buttons are grouped by type in several different areas on the record page .
by default , lightning experience includes the actions and buttons defined in the global publisher layout .
or you can customize what ’s available using the salesforce1 and lightning experience actions section on object page layouts .
here ’s the logic that determines where on the record page an action or button appears : •
most quick actions , productivity actions , standard buttons , and supported custom buttons are added to the page - level action menu • activities - related actions , such as log a call , new event , new task , and email , display in the composer on the activity tab . • standard chatter actions appear in the composer on the collaborate tab .
the order of actions in each of these areas is based on the order in which they ’ve been added to the global publisher or object page layout .
custom buttons custom buttons that use a url or javascript content source are n’t supported in lightning experience .
you can replace some of the functions covered by these buttons by using point - and - click tools like process builder , visual workflow , or code - driven approaches .
visualforce yes , lightning experience is an all new user interface , but that does n’t mean your visualforce pages stop working .
this release includes beta support for visualforce in lightning experience .
your existing visualforce pages work in lightning experience , many without needing any revisions .
because things have moved around in the new interface , there are some chores you ’ll want to complete to make sure your visualforce pages work the way you expect .
and at this point , there are a few visualforce features that do n’t work yet in lightning experience .
here are a few basic details to consider . •
if your visualforce pages use javascript , there are things you need to check
. visualforce does n’t “ own ” the whole page when shown in lightning experience , and because of that your javascript code needs to play by some new rules . •
if your visualforce pages use the built - in standard components , their look - and - feel matches salesforce classic , whether users access them in the new or old interface .
there ’s some work to do if you want your pages to match the lightning experience styling .
to help with this effort , we ’re publishing the salesforce lightning design system ( slds ) , a collection of design patterns , components , and guidelines for creating interfaces that fit in with lightning experience .
the slds is available today as a public beta at www.lightningdesignsystem.com .
for the complete skinny on what works and does n’t work , see the “ visualforce & lightning experience ” module in the developer trail - lightning experience trailhead trail .
what about new ui customization ?
the lightning component framework is our new ui framework for developing dynamic web apps for both desktop and mobile devices .
you can use it or visualforce in your new projects .
to learn more about ui development , see “
user interface development considerations ” in the lightning experience development trailhead module .
to learn more about lightning components , see the “ lightning components ” module in the developer trail - lightning experience trailhead trail .
force.com
canvas force.com canvas allows you to easily integrate third - party applications in salesforce .
canvas functionality in lightning experience is the same as in salesforce classic .
you can still embed canvas apps in visualforce pages and everywhere else they ’re supported — with the added bonus that you can expose canvas apps in lightning components .
63 salesforce winter ’16 release notes transition to lightning experience : let ’s do this !
salesforce apis and apex most of the programmatic tools and processes you ’ve used to are largely unaffected by lightning experience .
we ’ve kept our promise that our new releases wo n’t ever break your dependencies on salesforce apis .
tools like workbench haven’t changed .
your development environment is the same as ever .
while your apex classes and api calls work fine , there are some features that are n’t yet supported in lightning experience .
if a user is in the new interface and executes some apex code that interacts with an unsupported feature , the user ca n’t complete the task .
to address this scenario , we ’ve added capabilities to determine a user ’s interface preference from both the api and apex .
you can use this functionality to add logic to your existing code so that your users do n’t encounter errors .
see “ understanding changes to other development tools ” in the lightning experience development trailhead module for full details .
appexchange apps many apps from the appexchange feature customizations , including custom objects , custom buttons , visualforce pages , and more .
in preparation for the lightning experience release , salesforce partners are testing their apps and applying for lightning ready certification .
apps that are lightning ready will work in lightning experience and offer a more consistent experience with other lightning pages .
if an app is supported in lightning experience , a " lightning ready " sash appears on its appexchange listing .
if an app is n’t supported in lightning experience , use it in salesforce classic instead .
note :  apps without lightning ready certification can be used in lightning experience , but some features may not be available or work as expected .
these apps may also appear visually inconsistent with lightning experience because they use salesforce classic styling .
for the best experience , use salesforce classic for apps that are n’t certified as lightning ready .

take care you do n’t inadvertently enable or disable other features .
if you ’re going to limit lightning experience to a subset of your users , we recommend that you keep all members of a functional team on the same experience .
if you have team members who often share links and work closely together , include them all in your pilot .

professional • • performance • unlimited • developer enterprise when users are first enabled for lightning experience , the new interface is their default , preferred experience .
every time a user switches interfaces via the switcher , the user ’s default preference resets to the current environment .
with this behavior in mind , here are the typical link routing interactions your users can encounter .
user has the “ lightning experience ”
permission ?
user ’s default experience where links open yes
lightning experience for pages supported in lightning experience , links open in the new interface ( even for links generated in salesforce classic ) .
links to unsupported pages are directed to salesforce classic , which opens in a new tab .
this temporary redirection does n’t change the user ’s default preference to salesforce classic .
the next time the user selects a link that is 84 salesforce winter ’16 release notes lightning experience considerations user has the “ lightning experience ”
permission ?
user ’s default experience where links open yes
no supported in the new interface , the salesforce classic tab is reloaded to open the link in lightning experience .
salesforce classic links generally open in salesforce classic .
if a link was generated in lightning experience ( meaning it includes /one
/ one.app  in the url ) , the link opens in lightning experience .
the user ’s default preference is n’t changed to lightning experience .
salesforce classic links open in salesforce classic only .
if a link was generated in lightning experience ( meaning it includes /one
/ one.app  in the url ) , the link does n’t open , because the user ca n’t access lightning experience .
given these routing behaviors , you can see the potential for confusion if users share lightning experience links , typically via chatter posts or email , with salesforce classic users .
to avoid this problem , we recommend enabling the new interface for all users who work closely together .
we also recommend training your lightning experience users to understand how links and bookmarks work across the two experiences .

experience considerations related lists • related lists for supported standard objects and your custom objects are available in lightning experience .
related lists for objects that are n’t supported in lightning experience do n’t appear anywhere in the interface , even if they ’re included on an object ’s page layout . •
in lightning experience , related lists appear in related list cards on record home pages .
the first eight related lists show related list buttons , the first several records from the list , and a link to open the full list of records .
for any additional related lists , only the list name appears in the card .
users can still work with these related lists — simply click the related list name to access the full list .
here , users can see records in the list and use related list buttons ( such as new ) or row - level record actions . •
lightning experience includes new files and notes related lists , as well as the classic notes & attachments related list .
if you ’re using salesforce files or the enhanced notes feature , you ’ll want to include all of these related lists on your object page layouts . –
files and attachments are two different types of objects , and always have been .
files uploaded via the notes & attachments related list are simply files in lightning experience , but are attachments in salesforce classic .
for existing organizations , this means that the notes & attachments list can contain a mix of attachments that were uploaded in salesforce classic and files added in lightning experience .
files added in lightning experience have the functionality of salesforce files , while attachments are associated only with the particular record and ca n’t be shared further .
in the api , any existing integrations that retrieve attachments from the notes & attachments list do n’t include any files uploaded to the list in lightning experience .
a new api call is necessary to retrieve files as well as attachments .
– notes created with the old note - taking tool in salesforce classic are available from the notes & attachments related list only .
any notes created with the enhanced version of notes appear in the notes related list only . •
for group edition users , the contacts related list does n’t display on accounts . •
product details include a single price books related list , unlike salesforce classic , which includes related lists for standard prices and price books .
•
on the detail page for objects that support activities , salesforce does n’t display open activities or activity history along with other related lists .
it displays the activity timeline instead .
objects that support activities include opportunities , leads , accounts , contacts , and any custom objects on which you enable activities .
if you delete either activity related list from page layouts , salesforce does n’t display the corresponding timeline sections —
next steps or past activity — on those pages .

when testing lightning experience in a sandbox , be aware of these known issues .
these issues will be resolved when person accounts are supported in a future release .

activities differences in lightning
experience compared to salesforce classic activity timeline and activities related lists on the detail page for objects that support activities , lightning experience does n’t display open activities or activity history along with other related lists .

if you delete either activity related list from page layouts , salesforce does n’t display the corresponding timeline sections —
next steps or past activity — on those pages .
to represent all activities from future to past , the activity timeline displays open activities in the opposite order from the open activities related list .
under next steps , the timeline displays open activities in chronological order from top to bottom .
undated tasks appear at the top and overdue tasks appear last .
configuration of tabs in activity composer settings in some salesforce orgs prevent the activity composer on opportunities or other objects from displaying activity tabs .
to adjust your settings , see configure the call , task , and event tabs in the activity composer in lightning experience and configure the email tab in the activity composer in lightning experience .
customization of display and order of fields in activity timeline in the activity timeline , you can customize the display and order of fields for events , tasks , and logged calls using event and task compact layouts .
however , even if you remove certain fields from a layout , they remain in the timeline because they contain critical activity information .
for example , suppose that you remove the due date , the date and time , or the task status fields from the compact layouts .
the event start date and time , the task checkbox , the task due date , and the call logging date still appear on activities in the timeline .
the description field on events and the comments field on tasks also always appear in the timeline , although they are n’t available in the compact layout .
the remaining fields visible in the timeline reflect the fields you include in the compact layout .
customization of display and order of fields in task list in the task list , you can customize the display and order of fields for individual tasks using task compact layouts .
however , even if you remove certain fields from a layout , they remain in the task list because they contain critical task information .

the task checkbox and the due date still appear on tasks in the list .
the remaining fields visible in the list reflect the fields you include in the compact layout .

if you turn off case feed , cases look like other records .
activities and collaboration appear , but the feed - first design disappears and adds more clicks and context - switching to cases .
you can use collaboration ( chatter ) instead of feed , but collaboration does n’t include useful case feed publishers , such as email , log a call , or change status .
case comments
now you add comments to the feed instead of the case comments related list .
you ca n’t add comments to the related list in lightning experience .
the comments that appear there are from salesforce classic users .

lightning pages lightning page tabs and custom lightning pages are currently available for the salesforce1 mobile app only , and are n’t available in lightning experience .
108 salesforce winter ’16 release notes lightning experience considerations visualforce this release contains a beta version of visualforce for lightning experience that is production quality but has known limitations .
here are some of the most important considerations for organizations that have customized salesforce with visualforce .
for complete details , score yourself a new developer badge by completing visualforce & lightning experience in trailhead .
visualforce is wrapped in an iframe in lightning experience in salesforce classic , visualforce owns the entire page .
in lightning experience , it ’s wrapped in an embedded iframe instead .
this wrapper has a number of effects , and it ’s the main reason why a whole trailhead module is devoted to covering the details .
sforce.one  no
longer used just for salesforce1 the sforce.one  javascript utility object used to be available only on visualforce pages when running in salesforce1 .
if your organization enables lightning experience , it ’s also added to pages when running in lightning experience .
if you ’ve written code that makes assumptions about what the presence of sforce.one  means , you might need to update it .
you ca n’t set window.location a common technique in javascript to navigate to a new page is to manipulate the window.location  value .
this technique is n’t possible in lightning experience .
use the sforce.one  navigation methods instead .
object list action override is n’t accessible
the object list action , one of the six standard actions you can override with a visualforce page , is n’t accessible in lightning experience .
you can still override it , but your users ca n’t access it .
lightning experience app
user interface is always visible when running in lightning experience , visualforce pages ignore the < apex : page > showheader  and showsidebar attributes .
you ca n’t suppress the lightning experience header and sidebar .
page title ca n’t be set the < apex : page > title  attribute has no effect .
home does n’t support visualforce the new home in lightning experience ca n’t be customized , so you ca n’t add visualforce elements to it .
navigation menu does n’t support visualforce your ca n’t customize the navigation menu , so you ca n’t add visualforce items to it .
use the app launcher instead .
session privilege levels sessions obtained in a lightning experience context , by using $ api .
session_id  or getsessionid ( ) , have similar privileges to the lightning session .
as with the lightning session , you ca n't use these session ids to make api calls .

additional terms and conditions may apply to participate in the pilot program .
please note that pilot programs are subject to change , and as such , we can not guarantee acceptance into this pilot program or a particular time frame in which this feature can be enabled .
any unreleased services or features referenced in this document , press releases , or public statements are not currently available and may not be delivered on time or at all .

without replication , the dataflow performs a separate extract each time it needs data from a salesforce object .
166 salesforce winter ’16 release notes integrate data with replication enabled , the extraction happens ahead of time and behind the scenes .
your dataflow runs faster because it no longer has to extract the data — just load and transform .
when you sign up for replication , you get two dataflows : • the replication dataflow extracts salesforce data to build intermediate , locally cached datasets called replicated datasets . •
the user dataflow transforms data in the replicated datasets and loads it into registered datasets .
to create replicated datasets , configure the replication dataflow with up to 20 salesforce objects and set the replication schedule .
wave analytics will create a replicated dataset for each salesforce object that you choose .
note :  if you switch to using replication , you do n’t have to modify your existing user dataflow , except in the following cases : • remove any filters in the sfdcdigest transformation of the user dataflow and copy them to the replication dataflow .
if you do n’t remove them , the user dataflow fails . •
the user dataflow ca n’t extract data from objects that are n’t replicated .
if you ’re a wave analytics customer and you like what you ’ve heard so far , contact your salesforce representative and ask to join the replication pilot today !

waterfall , stacked waterfall chart types expand wave data exploration capabilities we ’ve added two new chart types — waterfall and stacked waterfall — you can use in wave analytics dashboards to show a running total as values are either added to or subtracted from it .
the new waterfall chart type , and the closely related stacked waterfall , visualizes the cumulative effect of sequentially introduced positive or negative values .
it 's also known as a " flying bricks " or " mario " chart .
use the new waterfall charts for wave visualizations that start with an initial value and show what happens to it as it ’s affected negatively or positively by some business factor and results in some final value .
for example , to visualize profits a waterfall chart would start with a bar representing your revenue , then show bars representing overhead costs that are subtracted from revenue , and finally show bars representing the resulting gross margin and net profit .
common use cases for the chart type include the following : •
sales analysis , where you compare target with actual and identify gaps • financial analysis , that is profit and loss • inventory analysis stacked waterfall charts show a breakdown of elements in waterfall chart bars . 171 salesforce winter ’16 release notes explore data with more flexible date filters , interface enhancements , and more the data for waterfall is provided by the query step .
the chart does n’t do any computation other than calculating the value for the final total bar .
you can choose to include the final total in the query , in which case you unselect the compute totals checkbox in the chart widget .
you create waterfall and stacked waterfall chart types in wave through dashboard json .
for details , see the wave analytics dashboard json guide .

the when  and then  keywords define a conditional statement .
a case  statement can contain one or more conditional statements . •
search_condition —
any logical expression that can be evaluated to true or false .
this expression may be constructed using any values , identifiers , logical operator , comparison operator , or scalar functions ( including date and math functions ) supported by saql .
examples of valid search_condition  syntax : – xint < 5 – price > 1000 and price < = 2000 –
units*round(price_per_unit ) < abs(revenue ) • result_expr — any expression that can be evaluated by the saql engine .
may contain values , identifiers , and scalar functions ( including date and math functions ) .
the expression may evaluate to any data type .
however , this data type must be consistent among all conditional statements .
that is , if result_expr is of numeric type , then result_expr2 …
result_exprn must be of numeric type .
examples of valid result_expr  syntax : – xint – tostring('orderdate ' , " dd / mm / yyyy " ) – " abc " else ( optional)—allows a default expression to be specified .
the else  statement must follow the conditional when / then statements .
there can be only one else  statement . •
default_expr —
any expression that can be evaluated by the saql engine .
may contain values , identifiers , and scalar functions ( including date and math functions ) .
the data type must be consistent with the data type of result_expr specified in the preceding conditional statements .
usage — searched case expression conditional statements are evaluated on a row by row basis in the order in which they are given .
if a search_condition  evaluates as true , the corresponding result_expr  is returned for that row .
therefore , if more than one of the conditional statements returns true , only the first one is evaluated .
at least one when / then  statement must be provided .
an unlimited number of when / then statements may be provided .
a default_expr  may be set with the optional else  statement .
if none of the search_condition  expressions evaluate to true , the default_expr  expression is returned .
if no else  statement is specified , null  is returned as the default . 177 salesforce winter ’16 release notes build powerful queries using saql syntax —
simple case expression case primary_expr when test_expr then result_expr [ when test_expr2 then result_expr2 … ] [ else default_expr ] end case ... end the case  and end  keywords begin and close the statement . •
primary_expr —
any scalar expression that can be evaluated by the saql engine .
may contain values , identifiers , and scalar functions ( including date and math functions ) .
the expression may evaluate to any comparable data type ( numeric , string , or date ) .
examples of valid primary_expr  syntax : – xint % 3 – date('year ' , ' month ' , ' day ' ) – " abc " note :  a scalar expression takes single values as input and outputs single values .
when used with the case  statement , the input values can be any expression that is valid in the context of a foreach statement .
when ... then the when  and then  keywords define a conditional statement .
a case  statement can contain one or more conditional statements . •
test_expr —
any scalar expression that can be evaluated by the saql engine .
this expression may be constructed using any values , identifiers , and scalar functions ( including date and math functions ) , but must evaluate to the same data type as the primary_expr .
examples of valid test_expr  syntax : – 5 – " abc " – abs(profit ) • result_expr — any scalar expression that can be evaluated by the saql engine .
may contain values , identifiers , and scalar functions ( including date and math functions ) .
the expression may evaluate to any data type .
however , this data type must be consistent among all conditional statements .
that is , if result_expr is of numeric type , then result_expr2 ... result_exprn must be of numeric type .
examples of result_expr  syntax : – xint – tostring('orderdate ' , " dd / mm / yyyy " ) – " abc " else ( optional ) the else keyword allows a default expression to be specified .
the else statement must follow conditional when / then statements .
there can be only one else  statement . •
default_expr —
any scalar expression that can be evaluated by the saql engine .
may contain values , identifiers , and scalar functions ( including date and math functions ) .
the data type must be consistent with the data type of result_expr  specified in the preceding conditional statements .
178 salesforce winter ’16 release notes build powerful queries using saql usage —
simple case expression conditional statements are evaluated on a row by row basis in the order that they are given .
if primary_expr = = test_expr for a given conditional statement , the corresponding result_expr  is returned for that row .
at least one when / then  statement must be provided .
an unlimited number of when / then statements may be provided .
a default_expr  may be set with the optional else  statement .
if primary_expr  does n’t equal any of the test_expr conditions , the default_expr  is returned .
if no else  statement is specified , null  is returned as the default .
tip :
this simple case expression syntax is shorthand for a common instance of the searched case expression syntax .
the first statement is simple case expression syntax and the second is searched case expression syntax .
both statements have the same meaning . case primary_expr when test_expr then result_expr when test_expr2 then result_expr2 else default_expr case else default_expr when primary_expr = = test_expr then result_expr when primary_expr2 = = test_expr2 then result_expr2 new keywords important :  these new keywords are no longer valid saql identifiers : case , when , then , else , end .
as of winter ‘ 16 , any syntax that uses these five keywords , in lowercase , results in a syntax error .
dashboards built with custom saql and wave rest api code that uses custom saql may be affected by this change .
to use these keywords as identifiers , enclose them in single quotation marks .
the following query is still legal : q = load " data " ; q = foreach q generate case as case , ' else ' ; q = filter q by ' end ' = = 0 ; in the previous example , case , else , and end  are field names from the dataset called " data " .
case  and case  are not keywords because saql is case - sensitive and only case  is a keyword .
the characters ' else '  and ' end '  are not keywords because they are enclosed in single quotation marks .
in this example , the use of when  as an identifier is illegal .
to make the syntax valid , surround the word in single quotes : ' when ' . q = load " data " ; q = foreach q generate when ; q = filter q by when < todate("01/05/2015 " , " mm / dd / yyyy " ) ; using case statements use case  statements in foreach  clauses .
do n’t use case  statements in order by , group by , or filter by clauses .
example :  this example query uses the simple case expression syntax : q = load " data " ; q = foreach q generate xint , ( case xint % 3 when 0 then " 3n " 179 salesforce winter ’16 release notes build powerful queries using saql when 1 then " 3n+1 " else " 3n+2 " end ) as modthree ; example :  this example query uses the searched case expression syntax : q = load " data " ; q = foreach q generate price , ( case when price < 1000 then " category1 " when price > = 1000 and price < 2000 then " category2 " else " category3 " end ) as pricelevel ; handling null values in general , null  values ca n’t be compared .
when search_condition , primary_expr , or test_expr  evaluates to null , the default_expr  specified by else  ( or null  if no else  clause is provided ) is returned .
for instance , the following query returns " other " whenever mea1  evaluates to null : q = load " data " ; q = foreach q generate mea1 , ( case mea1 when 0 then " type1 " when 1 then " type2 " else " other " end ) as category ; however , it is possible to specifically a condition on a null  value by using the is null  and is not null operations .
q = load “ data ” ; q = foreach q generate mea1 , ( case when mea1 is null then " is null " else "
is not null " end ) as category ; best practices for working with dates before you use date values in case  statements , use the saql todate ( )  function to convert the date values from strings or unix epoch seconds .
doing do ensures the most consistent comparisons .
example : q = load " data / dates " ; q = foreach q generate orderdate , ( case when todate(orderdate_epoch_secs ) < todate("2/1/2015 " , " m / d / yyyy " ) and todate(orderdate_epoch_secs ) > = todate("1/1/2015 " , " m / d / yyyy " ) then " jan " else " other " end ) as month ; order a cogrouped stream before a foreach statement you can order  a cogrouped stream before a foreach  statement . 180 salesforce winter ’16 release notes build powerful queries using saql
this saql orders from the left stream before the foreach statement : a = load " 0fbxx000000002qcaa/0fcxx000000002wcaq " ; b = load " 0fayy000000002qcaa/0fbyy000000002wcaq " ; c = cogroup a by year , b by year ; c = order c by a.airlinename ; c = foreach c generate year as year ; saql math functions use the saql math functions to perform numeric operations in saql queries .
you can use saql math functions in foreach statements and in the filter by  clause after a foreach  statement .
you ca n’t use saql math functions in group by  or order by  clauses , or in the filter by  clause before a foreach  statement .
this table lists the saql math functions : function abs(n ) description returns the absolute number of n as a numeric value .
n  can be any real numeric value in the range of -1e308 < = n  < = 1e308 .
these examples are valid : abs(-1.2345 ) = 1.2345 q = foreach q generate abs(pct_change ) as pct_magnitude ; these examples are invalid : q = group q by abs(pct_change ) ; q = order q by abs(pct_change ) ; ceil(n ) returns the nearest integer of equal or greater value to n. n can be any real numeric value in the range of -1e308
< = n < = 1e308 .
these examples are valid : ceil(-1.2345 ) = -1 ceil(1.2345 ) = 2 q = foreach q generate ceil(miles ) as distance ; these examples are invalid : q = group q by ceil(miles ) ; q = order q by ceil(miles ) ; floor(n ) returns the nearest integer of equal or lesser value to n. n can be any real numeric value in the range of -1e308
< = n < = 1e308 .
these examples are valid : floor(-1.2345 ) = -2 floor(1.2345 ) = 1 181 salesforce winter ’16 release notes build powerful queries using saql function description q = foreach q generate floor(miles ) as distance ; these examples are invalid : q = group q by floor(miles ) ; q = order q by floor(miles ) ; trunc(n [ , m ] ) returns the value of the numeric expression n  truncated to m  decimal places .
m  can be negative , in which case the function returns n truncated to -m  places to the left of the decimal point .
if m is omitted , it returns n truncated to the integer place .
n can be any real numeric value in the range of -1e308 < = n < = 1e308 .
m  can be an integer value between -15 and 15 inclusive .
these examples are valid : trunc(-1.2345 ) = -1 trunc(1.2345 ) = 1 trunc(2.355 , 2 ) = 2.35 trunc(-3455.8 , -1 ) = -3450 q = foreach q generate trunc(price , 2 ) as price ; these examples are invalid : trunc(1.2345 , 2.5 ) trunc(1.2345 , 1000 ) q = group q by trunc(price , 2 ) ; q = order q by trunc(price , 2 ) ; round(n [ , m ] ) returns the value of n  rounded to m  decimal places .
m  can be negative , in which case the function returns n rounded to -m  places to the left of the decimal point .
if m  is omitted , it returns n  rounded to the nearest integer .
for tie - breaking , it follows round half way from zero convention .
n  can be any real numeric value in the range of -1e308
< = n < = 1e308 .
m  can be an integer value between -15 and 15 , inclusive .
these examples are valid : round(-1.2345 ) = -1 round(2.355 , 2 ) = 2.36 round(-3455.8 , -1 ) = -3460 q = foreach q generate round(price , 2 ) as price ; these examples are invalid : round(1.2345 , 2.5 ) round(1.2345 , 1000 ) q = group q by round(price , 2 ) ; q = order q by round(price , 2 ) ; 182 salesforce winter ’16 release

with live chat sensitive data rules , you can block specific patterns , such as credit card , social security , phone , and account numbers , or even profanity .
you can choose to remove the text or replace it with your preferred characters .
you write a sensitive data rule as a javascript regular expression ( regex ) , and you can test and preview the rule before activating it .
you can block the text from agents , supervisors , customers , or all the above .
when a rule is triggered , it logs one of these new chat transcript events : • sensitive data blocked ( agent ) • sensitive data blocked ( supervisor ) • sensitive data blocked ( visitor ) create these rules under setup > live agent > sensitive data rules .
a few considerations :
sensitive data is visible while someone ’s typing , but is masked when the person sends it .
so if you want to mask customer information from agents , we recommend disabling agent sneak peek .
sensitive data rules apply to the auto - greeting and any quick text that you have enabled .
they do n’t apply to the agent name or other standard text in the chat window .

agents whose work they 're reviewing .
otherwise , the posts they approve result in an error .
if your user permissions include require social post approvals , then the submit button on the social publisher always reads submit for approval rather than " comment , " " tweet , " or other words .
this is true even if no active approval process apply to the user .
in that situation , clicking submit for approval publishes the social post normally since there is no active approval process in effect . 222 salesforce winter ’16 release notes social customer service
once agents submit a post , they can recall it before it is approved .
if a post is rejected the agent can retry the post .
when a post is approved , it is automatically published .
pending items can be approved in various ways within the salesforce application , as well as on mobile devices and using one - word replies to email notifications .
see create an approval process , the approval process checklist , and useful approval processes .
specifically for social posts , the social posts tab has a social posts pending approval  list view that allows you to review multiple pending posts and approve or reject them as desired .
223 salesforce winter ’16 release notes social customer service note :  once approvals are enabled , the approve posts and reject posts buttons remain on the social posts tab .
however they do n’t work for inbound and posts not needing approval .
tip :
if you approve a post from the social posts pending approval list view and a system interruption , session timeout , or other unexpected issue prevents the post from being published on the intended social network , an error message displays on the individual case only , not on the list view .
to help honor any commitments your company may have regarding response times on social networks , after approving posts from the list view , we recommend checking the posts ' statuses to ensure they were sent successfully and do n't need to be resent .
tip :  if your agents work with social post record detail pages , rather than in the case feed , we recommend removing the approvals related list from the page layout .
the same page layout is shared between inbound and outbound social posts .
removing the approvals related list avoids confusion when viewing an inbound post that is an invalid candidate for an approval process . approvers can still approve or reject posts through all other normal means such as email , chatter , and list views .
see also : social post approval default response handle if you have a portfolio of managed social accounts you may want to specify a particular account as the default author for your social customer service posts .
hence you can standardize and raise awareness of your brand ’s support by setting a dedicated support handle , for example @acmehelp or @acmesupport .
also , agents have fewer clicks when they are sending outbound posts because the chosen account appears as the default value in the account drop - down in the social publisher .
in setup , on the social accounts tab on the social customer service settings page ( which can be found by typing social c  in the quick find to narrow down the sidebar menu ) , you can set the default responses from  for each twitter , instagram ( pilot ) , and sina weibo ( pilot ) accounts .
224 salesforce winter ’16 release notes social customer service the default response handle does n’t apply for twitter direct messages and does n’t affect facebook , google plus , or linkedin , as they are restricted to the page handle itself .
more social networks to provide customer care ( pilot ) make your customers feel listened to and supported by engaging with them on the social networks where they ’re active .
you can now add linkedin and instagram to your list of social networks for providing customer care .
note :  social customer service for linkedin and instagram is currently available through a pilot program .
for information on enabling these features in your organization , contact salesforce.com .
just like with facebook , twitter , google+ ( pilot ) , and sina weibo ( pilot ) , you can monitor and respond to comments on your company ’s linkedin and instagram pages , including on your mobile phone .
comments made on your linkedin and instagram pages automatically create a cases with social post items in the case feed .
agents simply click reply to provide a personalized response .
note :  instagram follows and @mentions are not supported .
only the agent 's posts and customer comments under the agent 's own posts are supported .
social customer service experience enhancements learn about other changes that affect social customer service .
case source field the case object has a new case source field on the case object that indicates the social post where the case originated .
agents and support managers can gain a better understanding of a case ’s context by seeing the original interaction that generated the case .
you can add the case source field to the case object via its page layout .
persistence of social posts
when related records are deleted social posts are no longer also deleted when their parent record , usually a case , is deleted .
similarly , if a social post is associated with an account , contact , or lead through the polymorphic who field , deleting any of those related records does not affect the social post .
twitter direct message user setting twitter has introduced a user setting , receive direct messages from anyone , that allows users to receive messages from any other twitter user , even if they do not follow the other user .
this setting is off by default , meaning that unless they have manually enabled the new setting , users do not receive direct messages from any user they are n’t following .
when social customer service agents send a direct message , to ensure that the message is sent successfully , verify the outbound message ’s status in the case feed and/or confirm that the recipient is following the social account .

now , your customer support managers and agents can track how long agents are “ stopped ” or blocked from completing milestones .
service level agreements ( slas ) typically measure milestones in time , and agents must complete milestones by a deadline .
two new fields , stopped time and actual elapsed time , give managers and agents more insight into milestone completion times and sla compliance.s the stopped time  value is the total amount of time that the milestone clock was stopped between the time when the agent began working on a milestone and when the agent completed the milestone .
the elapsed time  value is the amount of time between the time when the milestone clocked started and when the agent completed the milestone .
the actual elapsed time  value is the amount of time that it took the agent actively worked on the milestone .

example :
for example , suppose that a milestone must be completed within 8 hours to satisfy the sla .
at 9 am , when the agent begins working on a milestone , the milestone clock starts ticking .
suppose that the agent needs more info from the customer .
at 10 am , the agent requests that info , and clicks the stopped time field to stop the milestone clock .
the customer does n’t reply until three hours later , at 1 pm , at which point the agent resumes working on the milestone .
the agent completes the milestone at 6 pm .
the stopped time  is 3 hours , the period from 10 am to 1 pm when the agent could n’t work on the milestone .
the actual elapsed time  is 6 hours , because the agent actively worked on the milestone from 9 - 10 am ( 1 hour ) and from 1 - 6 pm ( 5 hours ) . the elapsed time  is 10 hours , because the agent began working at 9 am and completed the milestone at 7 pm . 227 salesforce winter ’16 release notes organization sync organization sync

this option pauses the syncing of all data between your organizations .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
consider suspending your organization sync connection if : • you ’re experiencing a very high volume of sync failures and need to diagnose and correct the issue • you need to make significant changes in one or both organizations that will prevent data from syncing successfully to suspend your connection , navigate to your connection ’s detail page in the primary organization and click suspend at the top of the page .
editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer
if you ’re using a two - way sync and want to suspend updates in both directions ( recommended ) , click suspend in the secondary organization as well .
when the connection is suspended in both directions , updates made in either organization are added to the organization sync record queue .
suspending a connection in only one direction can lead to syncing errors .
228 salesforce winter ’16 release notes organization sync impact on users for most users , nothing changes when the connection is suspended .
users with the “ manage connections ” permission will notice some changes on the connection detail page : • a resume button appears in place of the suspend button . •
the connection history log shows a recent connection admin suspended event . •
the connection owner  field and the options to sync metadata , users , and audit fields are still updateable .
however , updates are n’t sent to the linked organization until the connection is resumed . •
depending on how long the connection has been suspended , the queue may contain more updates than usual . •
users do n’t see updates made in the linked organization while the connection is suspended .
the connection owner and the user who suspended the connection also receive an email twice per day that provides the number of events in the queue .
important :  if a user makes publishing or subscribing changes while the connection is suspended , those changes are n’t saved .
resuming the connection when you ’re ready to resume the connection , click resume on the connection detail page in the primary organization .
if you suspended the connection in both directions , click resume in the secondary organization as well .
when the connection is resumed , salesforce starts sending updates in the queue to the linked organization .
the time needed to process all of the queued updates varies depending on how large the queue is .
important :  as the queue fills up , it takes longer to get your two organizations back in sync .
to minimize syncing issues , resume the connection as soon as possible .

before you suspend your organization sync connection improvements to sync retries a new status  column in the organization sync log makes it easier to track the progress of syncing retries , while a faster initial retry time speeds up the error resolution process .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
when a user makes an update and the update fails to be sent to the linked organization , salesforce retries sending the update multiple times .
in winter ‘ 16 , the update is now added to the organization sync log with a retrying  status as soon as it fails .
after going through the retry process , the update appears a second time in the log with a status of either failed  or resolved .
note :  some syncing operations , such as the daily metadata sync and the bulk user sync , do n’t undergo the retry process .
if they lead to failures , they appear once in the organization sync log with a blank status  field .
editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer in addition , we ’ve cut down the time between the failure and the first retry from one hour to five minutes .
you ’ll see this reflected in the next retry date  column in the organization sync record queue .
the second retry still occurs two hours after the first retry .
the organization sync log now has a limit of one million entries .
when necessary , the oldest entries are periodically removed to stay within the limit .
and , two actions in the organization sync record queue were renamed for clarity : 229 salesforce winter ’16 release notes organization sync •

more flexibility in field publishing we ’ve made some changes to the way fields are published in organization sync connections .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
editions
previously , if a field was a lookup to an object that was n’t yet published , that field could n’t be published in organization sync .
in winter ’16 , lookup fields to unpublished objects appear in an object ’s list of publishable fields .
they ’re not automatically published , but you can publish them by clicking edit next to the object in the publishing objects section , selecting the field you want to publish , and clicking save .
for example , the account id  field on contacts includes a lookup to accounts .
if you haven’t yet published the account object , you can still publish the account id  field on the contact object .
however , in most cases , we recommend only publishing a lookup field if the object that it references is already published .
available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer if a custom field is n’t published to your linked organization or does n’t exist because it ’s part of managed package , the syncing of this field was previously logged as an error in the connection history log .
in winter ’16 , we no longer include these errors in the log .
custom fields that contain a user lookup are now automatically published and subscribed to along with standard fields .
this makes it extra important to keep user records current between your organizations .
if a user lookup field on a record in either organization lists a user that hasn’t been added to that organization , two things can happen : • if the field is required , the record fails to sync . •
if the field is optional , the record syncs but the field is blank .
note :  if you ’re an existing customer who chose to leave customer user lookup fields unpublished on your published objects , do n’t worry .
those fields remain unpublished .
options to sync users and metadata go their separate ways organization sync customers can now opt to automatically sync user data , metadata , or both .
if you prefer to just sync one or the other , separating these options makes it easier for you to implement your own syncing solution while still taking advantage of salesforce ’s automatic syncing capabilities .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
previously , organization sync connections included a sync metadata and users option .
that option is now replaced by two options : sync metadata and sync users .
these options appear as checkboxes on the connection invitation page if you ’re setting up a new connection , and at the top of the detail page for existing connections .
editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited •
developer selecting the sync metadata checkbox syncs metadata daily from the primary to the secondary organization .
you can edit this checkbox in the primary organization only .
selecting the sync users checkbox syncs user data in real time in both directions between the primary and secondary organizations .
if you want user updates to be synced only from the primary to the secondary organization , you can now deselect the sync users checkbox in the secondary organization .
this prevents user updates from being sent back to the primary organization .
230 salesforce winter ’16 release notes assets : keep track of your customers’ products to minimize syncing issues , we recommend selecting both the sync users and sync metadata options .
if you take a different approach , follow these best practices : • if you choose to sync users but not metadata , develop your own processes to keep user - related metadata current in the secondary organization .
if metadata such as user profiles are missing from the secondary organization , user replications may fail . •
if you choose to sync metadata but not users : – develop your own processes to keep user records current in your organizations .
if a record in the secondary organization references a user that does n’t exist in that organization , the field listing the user automatically updates to list the connection owner , and that field value then overwrites the correct value in the primary organization . –
the bulk sync users button no longer appears on the connection detail page in winter ‘ 16 .
if you need to trigger the immediate replication of user records , see managing user data in organization sync for a workaround .

users are n’t prevented from accessing the mobile browser app on older versions of the android operating system but may encounter performance or other issues that salesforce wo n’t address .
note :  a quick reminder that the salesforce1 for android downloadable app is supported on phones only .
while google play does n’t prevent users from installing the downloadable app on android tablets , be aware that the app is designed for phones and does n’t offer an ideal user experience on tablets .
it ’s also important to understand that salesforce does n’t provide support for any problems encountered when using the salesforce1 for android downloadable app on tablets .
as an alternative , we recommend using the salesforce1 mobile browser app on android tablets .
microsoft surface tablets run lightning experience instead of salesforce1
when microsoft surface and surface pro users log into salesforce , they now see the lightning experience desktop interface instead of the salesforce1 mobile interface .
end of support for salesforce1 mobile browser app on blackberry devices in winter
starting winter , the salesforce1 mobile browser app will no longer be supported on blackberry 10 devices .
after winter , users wo n’t be blocked from running the salesforce1 mobile browser app on blackberry z10 or z30 phones .
however , salesforce will no longer provide technical support , bug fixes , or enhancements for any issues your users may encounter .
to provide the best experience possible for mobile customers with blackberry 10 devices , salesforce is continuing to collaborate with blackberry on their native connect to salesforce app .
for a smooth transition , we recommend that blackberry users switch to the connect to salesforce app by the winter salesforce release .
blackberry ’s app is available for download from blackberry world .
test salesforce1 with mobile devices or device emulators ( instead of desktop browsers ) if you ’ve been testing your salesforce1 mobile app setup and customizations in a desktop browser by appending /one
/ one.app to your salesforce instance ’s url , this approach no longer works as of winter ’16 .
going forward , we recommend testing your custom pages and apps on supported mobile devices or in a device emulator .
starting with winter ’16 , the https://<salesforce_instance>/one / one.app url is used exclusively for lightning experience , which has its own distinct user interface .
you can still emulate salesforce1 on your desktop using a mobile device emulator .
download and install the appropriate sdk for your supported devices .
• apple ios simulator for iphone and ipad developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/ides/ conceptual / ios_simulator_guide/ • android virtual device emulator for phone and tablet developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html note :  running salesforce1 in an emulator is n’t supported for normal use , and it ’s not a substitute for full testing on your organization ’s supported mobile devices .
during development , you should regularly test your app on every device and platform on which you intend to deploy .
for on - the - fly testing on a desktop , you can still use the /one / one.app url , provided you use a browser that supports device mode emulation . do n’t forget to enable a mobile phone or table in device mode or
you 'll see the lightning experience interface !
keep in mind that using the /one / one.app  url when emulating a mobile device runs the salesforce1 mobile browser app .
the salesforce1 downloadable apps for ios and android — the apps that most customers use — are built with a mix of native and aura components , and have some different features as well .
so depending on what you ’re testing in a desktop browser , you can get an inaccurate representation of how your page or app will behave in real life .

as before , the list displays up to 20 of a user ’s most recent notifications from the last 90 days .

why you must get the winter ’16 templates with lightning components update your koa , kokua , and napili templates to make them compatible with the lightning platform and lightning components .
lightning technology is more performant and delivers a richer visual experience on both desktop and mobile devices .
the winter ’16 version of community templates is a prerequisite for many powerful community builder and template features in winter ’16 and later releases .
we strongly recommend that you update your community template immediately , or plan for it in the coming months so you can make the most of powerful community builder and template functionality .
the benefits include the ability to create custom pages , add components to pages , create and use custom lightning components in your communities , and expose additional salesforce objects .
another big advantage is that you can edit almost all koa , kokua , and napili template pages and components directly in community builder .
you no longer need to use site.com studio , except for a few site configuration settings .
not sure what your template version is ?
check your template version in community builder .
important :  customer support for templates older than the winter ’16 version will be discontinued with the summer ’16 release .
if you choose not to upgrade your template by then , your community will not be affected .
however , if any issues arise with those templates , our customer support team wo n’t be able to provide assistance .
a few important things to keep in mind : •
after you update your template , all template and component customizations are lost .
only the topic navigation carries over .
most of the branding specified via the branding editor in community builder carries over , but some community colors may be reset to the default values .
after you update , check your branding properties in community builder and customize any that changed .
for more information , see update your community ’s template  in the salesforce help .
• new template components introduced in winter ’16 are not compatible with older template versions .
for more information about component compatibility , see which components
can i use with each template ? in the using templates to build communities guide . •
this update affects only communities that use the koa , kokua , and napili templates .
communities built using the salesforce tabs + visualforce template wo n’t be affected .
compatibility with lightning experience the winter ’16 versions of koa , kokua , and napili and lightning experience use the same underlying technology : the lightning platform and lightning components .
that said , you are n’t required to enable lightning experience in your organization to upgrade your community templates .
also , salesforce communities is not supported in lightning experience .
a few considerations of note if you ’re planning to enable lightning experience in your organization : • lightning experience does n’t support the global header .
this means that internal users in your organization ca n’t switch between the internal salesforce organization and your communities from lightning experience .
if you do enable lightning experience in your organization , they will need to switch back to salesforce classic to access the global header .
• salesforce communities is not supported in setup in lightning experience .
to make any changes to your communities in setup , you must switch back to salesforce classic .

important :  if your community is active , your navigation menu item changes will immediately appear to your community members .
that ’s it !
this creates a navigation menu item , which links to a list of the selected object ’s records .
under the hood , your data is retrieved from salesforce and displayed using the generic record list page .
this page is available out - of - the - box in napili and uses the record home list view lightning component to display data in an appropriate layout .
note :  the generic record list page provides the default list view layout for objects that do n’t have a predefined or custom list view page assigned .
for example , if you create a navigation menu item for another salesforce object , it ’ll use this same page .
if you reconfigure the record list page , be sure to account for all the affected objects .
a few important things to note about record list views . •
users can access only records they have access to via licenses , profiles , permissions , and sharing rules , same as in salesforce .
users with the " create " permission for the object can create new records from the list view page . •
when users click on a record on this page , the record details are displayed using the layout from the generic record detail page .
if you create a custom record detail page and assign it to the object , we use that page instead . •
you can hide a navigation menu item from guest users , so they wo n’t be able to access the list view page .
• clicking on a record in the list view displays the record detail page , which uses the generic record detail page layout . •
the record list page and the record home list view component are not available in the koa and kokua templates .
creating custom list views if you prefer to use a custom list view page for an object , you can create a new page in community builder .
choose the standard page with single column layout , add the record home list view component to the page and configure the component properties to point to the object , then publish the page .
to link to the page , create a custom navigation menu item and use the internal page url .
example :
a list view page for a custom object called featured products

why you must get the winter ’16 templates with lightning components view and create record detail pages in napili display record details using the generic record detail page or create custom record detail pages .
note :  you must update your community ’s template to the winter ’16 version to use this functionality .
napili supports an out - of - the - box record detail layout that you can use immediately with no configuration , same as salesforce .
all objects without a preassigned record detail page use the generic record detail page to display record data .
for example , consider the scenario where a user lands on a case detail page ( that uses a preassigned case detail layout ) and clicks a contact in the related records .
if you haven’t created a custom record detail page for contacts , the contact information is displayed using the generic record detail page .
under the hood , the record detail page uses the record headline and record information lightning components to display record data . •
record headline : displays the record name and key record highlights along with buttons to edit and delete the record . •
record information : displays all record details including related records and the record feed .
it also allows users to create new related records and post to the record feed .
a few important things to keep in mind about record detail pages : • objects with preassigned active record detail pages use those layouts for record data ( cases , for example ) .
you can check page assignments and availability for each object in community builder settings , under page management . •
we do n’t block unsupported objects ( leads and opportunities , for example ) from related lists .
however , when users click a record for an unsupported object , they see an error message that directs them to contact their administrator .
• objects without preassigned record detail pages use the generic record detail page .
if you modify the record detail page layout or configuration , be sure to account for all objects that use this page layout . •
users with the necessary permissions can create records from the related lists , and edit and delete the record from the record headline .
users without the necessary license , profile , and permissions ca n’t access record data . •
the record information and record headline are driven by object page layouts defined in salesforce .
for example , if you ’ve hidden a field on the account page layout in salesforce , that field wo n’t display in the community either .
this feature includes support for record types . •
you must enable feeds on records in salesforce to allow users to post on them in communities .

you can get out - of - the - box insights with the salesforce communities dashboards appexchange package or you can create and map your own .
the appexchange package will be available shortly after the winter ’16 release .
insights help community managers nurture and encourage community engagement and adoption by allowing them to easily drill down to the source of activity .
you can set up insights to monitor new members , unanswered questions , newly created groups , trending topics , and even recent contributions .
for example , with an insights report set up to track new members , community managers can quickly navigate to a new member ’s profile to send them a welcome message .
281 salesforce winter ’16 release notes community management they can also access other reports about members directly from the page using the drop - down menu .
how does it work ?
insights pages map to report folders in your internal organization .
all the reports included in that folder are displayed in the drop - down menu on the insights page .
adding or removing an insights report from the report folder in your internal organization updates the insights page in community management .
on the insights page , entity links are automatically created for fields such as created by  or group name .
this link is what allows community managers to easily drill down to the source of activity and take action .
how do i get out - of - the - box insights ?
install the winter ’16 version of the salesforce communities dashboards package , which is available on the appexchange shortly after the winter ’16 release .
to use the preconfigured insights reports , your community must use chatter .
when you install the package , insights report folders are installed in your internal organization and then mapped to insights pages in community management .
during installation , you can give your community managers access to the package contents , saving you from the task of sharing folders later .
after installation , expand insights in community management and check out the new pages and reports .
if you decide that the prepackaged insights are n’t working for you , customize them .
to add or remove columns and update filters , click edit report on the insights page .
the package provides the following insights pages : • adoption to monitor member activity .
• engagement to track posts and comments in groups . •
files to monitor file uploads and downloads , including files receiving lots of comments . •
groups to help with group management . • moderation to track flagged posts , files , messages , and content flagged by moderation rules .
282 salesforce winter ’16 release notes community management • self - service to track questions and answers in user profiles , including questions escalated to cases .
this insights page is great for communities using the napili template .

the salesforce communities dashboards package automatically maps seven pages , leaving you three pages to customize yourself .
however , you can always rename , customize , or replace any of the prepackaged insights pages .
for information about the salesforce communities dashboards package , see report on communities with the appexchange package in the salesforce online help .
can i create my own insights ?
yes .
keep in mind that insights reports must be tabular - based reports , return 2,000 rows or less , and ca n’t include pagination .
save the reports in a new report folder that you ’ll use for mapping in community management .
in the report folder , make sure that you only include reports you want to use for insights because once mapped , any report included in this folder appears in community management .
remember to give your community managers access to the insights report folders in your internal organization .
to set up insights for your community , go to the insights > settings page in community management .
for more information , see create insights to display in community management .
confused about the difference between insights and dashboards ?
use insights to view , monitor , and act on your community ’s activity .
insights give you a super - focused look at a specific area of your community .
use dashboards to view your community ’s analytics , such as metrics and trends on activity .
dashboards give you mid - term to long - term views on adoption and engagement in your community .
they help you monitor return on investment ( roi ) and key performance indicators ( kpi ) .
you can visit the insights > adoption page to view a report about new members in your community that have received the most likes on their posts and comments .
this insights report helps you identify and engage with your active new members that are receiving positive feedback from other community members .

create triggers to customize file sharing behavior to customize file sharing behavior , define an apex trigger for the contentdistribution or contentdocumentlink objects .
the contentdistribution object represents a file shared externally .
a contentdocumentlink represents a file shared with an internal object , such as a user , group , or record .
301 salesforce winter ’16 release notes files the contentdocumentlink object supports triggers before and after these operations : insert , update , delete .
the contentdistribution object supports triggers before and after these operations : insert , update , delete .
it supports triggers after undelete .
some common use cases for content triggers are : • publish content to multiple libraries . •
prevent sharing specific files or specific file types .
• deliver content to certain users , profiles , or groups .
• deliver content only if external sharing is allowed .
• verify that the latest version of a file is shared .
example :  rita has a “ managing ” library , which she uses to hold all her team ’s content .
when content is published to this library , she also wants to publish it to another library depending on the owner of the content .
you can write a trigger for the contentdocumentlink object that , when content is published to the managing library , publishes the same content into another library .
trigger publishconenttoanotherlibrary on contentdocumentlink ( after insert ) { for ( contentdocumentlink cdl : trigger.new ) { string docid = cdl .
contentdocumentid ; if ( cdlhelper.shouldpublishtoanotheribrary(cdl ) ) { cdlhelper.sharewithlibrary(docid ) ; } } } the trigger calls this helper class .
public class cdlhelper { : docid ] ; if(cd.size ( ) > 0 ) { : docid].get(0).ownerid ; } return ownerid ; } / * * * helper method to get ownerid of contentdocument .
* / public static string getcontentdocumentowner(string docid ) { string ownerid ; list < contentdocument > cd = [ select ownerid from contentdocument where i d = ownerid = [ select ownerid from contentdocument where i d = / * * * helper method to publish contentdocument into another library .

public class cdlhelper { / * * * gets fileextension of the inserted content .
* / public static string getfileextension(contentdocumentlink cdl ) { string fileextension ; string docid = cdl .
contentdocumentid ; fileextension = [ select fileextension from contentversion where contentdocumentid = : docid].get(0).fileextension ; return fileextension ; } / * * * checks the file 's publishstatus and fileextension to decide whether user can share the file with others .

linkedentityid ; if ( id.substring(0,3 ) = = ' 001 ' ) { name = [ select name from account where i d = : id].get(0).name ; } return name ; } } example :  the vp of marketing wants file authors to specify whether their files can be shared with external people using content delivery .
he also wants some files to have a password .
you can add a custom field deliverypolicy  on the contentversion object .
make the custom field a picklist with the values , allowed , blocked , and password required .
add the field to the contentversion layout so that the user can set the delivery policy per file .
then , add an insert trigger for the contentdistribution object to enforce the rules based on the delivery policy set in the file .
this trigger for the contentdistribution object enforces the delivery policy rules for each file : trigger deliverypolicy on contentdistribution ( before insert ) { for ( contentdistribution cd : trigger.new ) { string versionid = deliverypolicyhelper.getcontentversionid(cd ) ; contentversion version = [ select deliverypolicy__c from contentversion where i d = : versionid ] ; string policy = version . deliverypolicy__c ; if ( policy.equals('blocked ' ) ) { cd.adderror('this file is not allowed to be delivered . ' ) ; } else if ( policy.equals('password required ' ) ) { if ( ! deliverypolicyhelper.requirepassword(cd ) ) { cd.adderror('to deliver this file , set a password . ' ) ; } } } } the trigger calls this helper class : public class deliverypolicyhelper { public static string getcontentversionid(contentdistribution cd ) { if ( cd .
contentversionid !
= null ) { return cd . contentversionid ; } else { string versionid = [ select latestpublishedversionid from contentdocument where i d = : cd .
contentdocumentid].get(0).latestpublishedversionid ; 304 salesforce winter ’16 release notes user profiles return versionid ; } } public static boolean requirepassword(contentdistribution cd ) { return cd .

see more relevant information in your chatter feed we changed the way chatter selects posts for your news feed ( what i follow ) .
previously , if you followed a person in chatter , everything that other people posted to that person ’s profile showed up in your news feed .
with the new follow feature , you no longer see updates from people you do n’t follow .
the new follow feature is automatically enabled in all new orgs .
contact salesforce to get this feature for an existing org .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
the new follow model makes your chatter news feed more relevant , because it shows you the updates from the people you actually follow .
you also see updates from groups you belong to and records you follow .
we did n’t change the way the follow feature works on groups and records .
here are some tips that help you get the most out of the new follow feature .
313 salesforce winter ’16 release notes feeds • review your following list on your profile page .
follow the people that are relevant to your work and from whom you want to see updates . •
when you post an update on a coworker ’s profile , remember that only that coworker , the people who follow you , and people you @mention see your post .
if you want to reach a broader audience , post to a group that has the type of members you want to reach .
see the most relevant suggestions when mentioning people or groups relevant @mentions make it easier than ever before to quickly mention people and groups .
this new algorithm learns your behavior to suggest the people and groups with which you interact the most .
in private groups , it suggests members of the group , helping to find and mention people fast .
suggested names are sorted alphabetically .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .

similar questions and articles in chatter questions ( generally available )
it ’s now easier to reduce duplicate content in your organization or community .
when an internal user or a community user enters a question in chatter , they now see similar questions — and if desired , relevant knowledge articles — in a drop - down list as they type .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
editions note : • the similar questions and similar articles search features are available in internal salesforce organizations , communities built using salesforce tabs + visualforce , and communities built using the napili template .
to learn how they work in napili communities , see display
similar questions and articles in napili search ( generally available ) . •
similar questions and similar articles are n’t available in salesforce1 or mobile browsers . •
similar articles was previously available in beta release , but was referred to as knowledge deflection .
available in : • group •
professional • developer • performance • enterprise • unlimited when a user enters a question in chatter using the question action , similar questions automatically appear in a drop - down list below the title field .
you can enable similar articles to display relevant knowledge articles along with similar questions : 1 .
from setup , enter knowledge settings  in the quick find box , then select knowledge settings .
2 .
under chatter questions settings , select display relevant articles as users ask questions in chatter ( also applies to communities with chatter ) .
drop - down search results of similar questions and articles : • 1 : book and question mark icons indicate whether a search result is an article or a question . 314 salesforce winter ’16 release notes other changes in chatter • 2 : question results show the question title , number of answers , and a green flag with the text answered  if a best answer was selected .
users see up to 10 results in the drop - down list , with questions appearing first .
salesforce displays an equal number of questions and articles , but if there are n’t enough of one result type , extra results of the other type are displayed .
if no question or article title matches the text entered , the drop - down list does n’t appear .
the drop - down results are based on whether the question or article title contains the text entered by the user .
the search accounts for partially matching terms and non - adjacent terms ; for example , the results for “ best backpack ” could include a question titled “
which backpack is best for day hikes ? ” , and the results for “ backpack
” could include an article titled “ backpacking tips . ” if the user wants to conduct a more in - depth search that also scans question descriptions and article text , they can press tab or click out of the title field .
this displays a separate drop - down list of results below the question publisher .
advanced drop - down search results of similar questions and articles : if none of the results answer the user ’s question , they can post their question by clicking ask .

get more relevant search results we ’ve improved the way the search engine stores your org ’s information and matches it to your users’ search terms .

see also : how and when search features become available search faster by disabling search for some custom objects choose which custom objects your users can search by enabling the allow search setting on the custom object setup page .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
previously , all your org ’s custom objects were searchable by default via the api , and the salesforce user interface when associated with a custom tab .
the search index stored each custom object ’s record information , even if you did n’t need the information to be searchable .
making a custom object searchable when you do n’t need your users to find its records slows down searches across your org .
if you do n’t need a custom object ’s records to be searchable , disable search for that custom object . disabling search for custom objects does n’t change the way your org interacts with the objects outside of search .
in winter ’16 , search is disabled by default for new custom objects .
note :  no changes have been made to custom objects created before winter ’16 .
your users can still find matching records for those custom objects when they search .
for more information , see “
guidelines for making search faster ” in the salesforce help .
example :  the company acme uses a custom object called web_metrics__c to track activity on the company ’s site .
the object contains fields for a customer ’s account i d , date of last visit , and date of purchase .
acme then uses the information it collects to programmatically determine what communications to send to its customers .
acme users do n’t need to find web_metrics__c records in search results because the values in the metrics fields are meaningful only to the programmatic process .
in fact , including these records in search results distracts users from the results they ’re really looking for .
so acme disabled search for web_metrics__c .
now all searches across the org are faster , and when users search for a particular account id that ’s associated with web_metrics__c records , they do n’t see the web_metrics__c records in search results and they can more easily find the account record they ’re looking for .
317 salesforce winter ’16 release notes get more relevant search results get more relevant search results we ’ve improved the way the search engine stores your org ’s information and matches it to your users’ search terms .
the search engine ’s more precise matching rules make it easier for your users to find the information they ’re looking for when they search for terms that include punctuation , such as website addresses and file paths .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
typically , the search engine ignores certain punctuation symbols in both the search index and the search term .
in most cases , ignoring punctuation symbols returns the most meaningful results , and your users are able to find the information they ’re looking for .
however , in some instances , removing punctuation symbols returns irrelevant results .
the search engine now handles punctuation differently in instances when doing so gives your users more relevant results .
when users search for terms that contain punctuation symbols , the search results can contain : • alternate punctuation symbols from those entered in the search term • search terms separated by other words , phrases , or punctuation symbols • search terms split up and matched to record information in a different order for more details , see " how does search break up information ? " in the salesforce help .
example :  when users search for the following terms , they could find records with these corresponding terms in the results .
search term a1b1 acme.com sysmail.xml results added sku - a1b1 www.acme.com z:\app / sysmail.xml
sysmailxml results removed skua no results zapp exhibit-69530 ghccops - exhibit-69530-abc no results ghccops - exhibit-69530 xx.69530_exhibit : yy 69530.xx_yy:exhibit exhibit.xx_yy:69530 these improvements are available on a rolling basis starting with the summer ’15 release and before the spring ’16 release .
get more relevant search results in japanese when users search for a term in japanese hiragana , they can now find corresponding matching search results in japanese katakana , and vice versa .
the search engine recognizes the two scripts as interchangeable .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
example :  when users enter the search term とうきょう in japanese hiragana to find items that contain the word tokyo , they find records that contain the word tokyo in japanese katakana , トウキョウ. find matching records for nicknames find your records with less guessing .
the search engine automatically returns results associated nicknames .

administrators change the secondary field that appears under the primary record name field displayed in instant results for global search and lookup dialog search .
for example , the billing city would display as the secondary field for account record names .
the secondary field is automatically populated using the second usable field as defined in search layouts .

depending on user permissions , the data import wizard also lets you import data for custom objects .
starting in winter ’16 , the individual import wizards remain accessible only from the legacy data import tools page until they ’re officially retired .
you can currently access the individual import wizards for accounts , contacts , person and business accounts , leads , solutions , and custom objects until they are officially deprecated .
from setup , click data management > data import wizard .
on the data import wizard page , click legacy data import tools .

schedule multiple groups of actions
you ’re no longer limited to just one schedule when you configure time - dependent actions in the process builder .
with multiple schedules it ’s easier to optimize sales responsiveness , automate follow - up on important cases and opportunities , and support your business needs all within a single process .
for example , when an opportunity with an amount greater than $ 500,000 is won , your process can now execute multiple groups of scheduled actions , such as : • create a related contract record one day after the opportunity ’s closed date ( 1 ) • send a follow - up email to the account owner two days after the opportunity ’s last modified date ( 2 ) • send a satisfaction survey 10 days after the opportunity ’s closed date ( 3 ) 355 salesforce winter ’16 release notes process builder reduced chances of hitting soql limits in processes we ’ve continued to optimize how we bulkify elements in processes so you avoid hitting existing platform limits as your business scales and grows .
with bulkification , processes properly handle more than one operation at a time .
if a transaction ’s operations would normally violate limits , the operations are grouped and performed in batches .
example : before winter ’16 the process issues 200 soql queries for the transaction .
because the limit is 100 soql queries , the entire transaction fails , and none of the cases are uploaded .
for the upload to succeed , you reduce the batch size to 100 records and try again .
as of winter ’16
the process buckets as many of the queries together as it can without reaching the 20,000 character limit for soql queries .
in this example , the bucketing results in a handful of queries .
the process then issues the bucketed queries for the transaction .
because the limit is 100 soql queries , the transaction does n’t fail , and the cases are uploaded .

example : every waiting flow interview has an associated user — the person who caused the interview to start waiting .

example :  your process starts when an account balance is more than $ 500,000 .
the process waits three days before sending a reminder email , which includes the account balance value , to the account owner .
when the scheduled action executes after three days , the process also checks whether the account 's balance is still more than $ 500,000 .
if the account balance has been updated and it still meets the criteria , the follow - up email uses the new value . 357 salesforce winter ’16 release notes visual workflow
previously , scheduled actions executed based on the data from the record only at the time the process started , not when the scheduled action(s ) started .
other changes in the process builder a schedule now needs an action defined before you can activate the process .
we also changed how we support operators in update records filters .
a schedule needs actions before you can activate a process
previously , you could activate a process if it had either an immediate action or a schedule defined ( even if the schedule contained no actions ) .
we made a slight change so you ca n’t activate a process if it has a schedule defined but no scheduled actions .
changes in support for operators in update records filters some field and operator combinations are no longer supported in update records filter conditions .
for processes with update records actions , if you filter the record you update : • using an id field , you ca n’t use the contains , starts with , or ends with operators . •
using a multi - select picklist field , you ca n’t use the contains operator .
for example , your process updates a case record when a related account is platinum , but you do n’t want to update the case if it has a closed status . you can define filters so that the case is n’t updated if the status ( a multi - select picklist field ) equals closed , but you ca n’t define this same filter using the contains operator .
visual workflow this release , we ’re introducing a bunch of enhancements geared toward making your life as a flow admin easier .
we bulkified queries so you ’re less likely to hit limits and made it easier to create choices based on picklist fields .

with bulkification , flows handle more than one operation at a time .

in one transaction , the same flow is triggered for each case .
in the flow , a record lookup finds the corresponding account .

an error occurred at element submit_record .
no applicable approval process was found .
then it gives details about the flow and the flow interview , including who started the interview and whether any variables were set when it started .
this example flow was distributed through a custom button on an opportunity , which is where the values for opptyid  and accountid  come from .

dynamic choice renamed to “ dynamic record choice ”
we 've changed the resource name to make the differences between the three choice resources more intuitive .
here ’s a recap of the three choice resources for flows .

• picklist choice — dynamically creates a set of choices based on the values for an existing picklist or multi - select picklist field .

because pilot programs are subject to change , we ca n’t guarantee acceptance .
this pilot feature is n’t generally available , as referenced in this document or in press releases or public statements .
we ca n’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all .
make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available features .
without object - specific share locks , you ca n’t submit simultaneous sharing changes until recalculation across all objects is complete .
if you are enabling object - specific share locks , consider the following changes in your organization .
criteria - based and ownership - based sharing rules recalculation is run if a sharing rule has changed or when you click the recalculate button on the sharing settings page . clicking this button locks sharing rules for that object ( 1 ) , but you can still make changes to sharing rules for another object .
note :  you do n’t need to recalculate each time you edit or create a sharing rule .
only use the recalculate buttons on the sharing rules related lists if sharing rule updates have failed or are not working as expected .
the administrator will receive a notification email if sharing rule updates have failed .
364 salesforce winter ’16 release notes sharing when an ownership - based sharing recalculation is in progress , you ca n’t create , edit , or delete ownership - based sharing rules for an object that targets the affected group of users .
for example , let ’s say you ’re creating an ownership - based lead sharing rule targeting all internal users .
you can create , update , or delete another ownership - based sharing rules for leads targeting all internal users only after the recalculation finishes .
you ’ll receive an email notification when the recalculation is complete .
however , you can still create another ownership - based sharing rules for leads targeting any other public group except the all internal users group , while the recalculation from the creation of the first sharing rule is still in progress .
when a criteria - based sharing recalculation is in progress , you ca n’t edit or delete that rule ( 2 ) .
but you can simultaneously create , edit , or delete any other criteria - based or ownership - based sharing rule .
you ca n’t modify the organization - wide defaults when a recalculation is running and vice versa .
account , cases , contacts , and opportunities sharing rules can affect accounts and the associated account children — cases , contacts , and opportunities , so they are locked together to ensure that recalculation runs properly .
for example , creating and editing account sharing rules prevents you from creating or editing a case , contact , or opportunity sharing rule .
similarly , creating or editing an opportunity sharing rule prevents you from creating or editing a case , contact , or account sharing rule before recalculation is complete .
note that locks are not shared across objects , except in the case of accounts and associated account children .
note :  clicking the recalculate button for any of these four objects’ sharing rules prevents anyone from making changes to any sharing rules for those objects until recalculation is completed .
in the following example , an ownership - based account sharing rule has been deleted and recalculation is in progress .
although you ca n’t create , edit , or delete another ownership - based sharing rule belonging to any of these objects , you can make changes to a criteria - based sharing rule ( 3 ) belonging to those objects . 365 salesforce winter ’16 release notes

depending upon the policy , the real - time actions that can be taken are : • notify a salesforce admin that the policy was triggered •
block access • require the use of two - factor authentication • require the end of a current login session transaction security includes a predefined concurrent sessions limiting policy and a corresponding apex class to implement the policy .
an administrator can edit the apex class to modify it , and enable the policy immediately .
for example , suppose that you activate the concurrent sessions limiting policy to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user .
in addition , you change the policy to notify you via email when the policy is triggered .
you also update the policy ’s apex implementation to limit users to three sessions instead of the default five sessions .
( that ’s easier than it might sound . )
later , a user with three login sessions tries to create a fourth .
the policy prevents that and requires the user to end one of the existing sessions before proceeding with the new session .
at the same time , you are notified that the policy was triggered .

the following test options are available when you deploy or validate an inbound change set .
default keeps the default behavior for all tests .
in sandbox , no tests are executed .
in production , all local tests are executed if your change sets contain apex classes or triggers .
local tests are all tests , except the ones that originate from managed packages .
if your package does n’t contain apex components , no tests are run .
run local tests all tests in your organization are run , except the ones that originate from installed managed packages .
this test level is the default for production deployments that include apex classes or triggers .
run
all tests all tests in your organization are run , including tests of managed packages .
383 salesforce winter ’16 release notes improved deployment experience
during service upgrades run specified tests only the tests that you specify are run .
provide the names of test classes in a comma - separated list .
note :  code coverage requirements differ from the default coverage requirements when using this level in production .
the executed tests must cover the class or trigger modified in your change sets with a minimum of 75% code coverage .
this coverage is computed for each class or trigger individually and is different from the overall coverage percentage .

improved deployment experience
during service upgrades if your deployment was running tests during a salesforce service upgrade , test execution now resumes after the service is restored .
results of already executed tests are preserved and those tests are n’t rerun , saving you time .
previously , test execution was restarted from the beginning .
this enhancement applies to file - based deployments started with the metadata api or a tool , such as the force.com migration tool .
this enhancement does n’t apply to change sets .
salesforce performs major service upgrades three times a year , and other maintenance updates throughout the year .
although it is n’t common that the deployment falls within a service upgrade , this enhancement makes deployments more resilient .
note :  to check whether your salesforce instance is due for an upgrade , see http://trust.salesforce.com .

improved sandbox copy engine for developer and developer pro sandboxes ( generally available ) we ’ve rebuilt our sandbox copy engine to optimize performance , scalability , and customer success .
the new engine impacts developer and developer pro sandboxes as they are created and existing developer and developer pro sandboxes as they are refreshed .
several enhancements to the copy engine make sandbox creation and refresh faster and minimize sandbox inconsistencies .
these improvements are available on a rolling basis during the winter ’16 release .
intelligent routing the copy engine selects the best instance for your sandbox based on available storage space , cpu consumption , and import activity on each sandbox instance .
new data copy framework the copy engine divides your organization ’s data into small chunks for exporting and copying to the sandbox .
copying is faster , because chunks are processed in parallel .
importing begins as soon as the first data chunk is exported .
export and import are independent , so the system is robust and flexible .
new post - copy framework if a production organization changes during sandbox creation or refresh , the sandbox can contain data inconsistencies .
the new automated post - copy process quickly fixes these inconsistencies after copying is complete and tracks the fixes .
progress tracking you can monitor the progress of your sandbox creation or refresh .
from setup , click sandboxes or data management > sandboxes to view a list of your sandboxes .
the list displays a progress bar for sandboxes in the queue , in process , or recently completed .
hover over the progress bar to view the percentage completed of a copy in progress .
click a name to go to a detail page showing information about the sandbox , including how much time before the next available refresh .
if your sandbox is suspended or stopped for more than one hour , contact salesforce customer support .
note :  full sandboxes began using the new engine in summer ’15 .
all other sandbox products will use the new engine in later releases .

iframe>. this double wrapping ensures that canvas apps are isolated from salesforce in all contexts , except via the canvas apis .
in prior releases canvas apps were embedded in only one < iframe >  tag .
if you ’ve written javascript to integrate a canvas app with salesforce and you ’ve used parent.postmessage ( )  to send messages across the iframe boundary , the extra iframe breaks your code .
the resolution is to revise your code to use the official canvas apis to handle your integration .
using parent.postmessage ( )  or similar techniques that depend on the frame hierarchy is inherently fragile .
use the documented canvas apis for sending and receiving events because that ’s the best way to isolate yourself from implementation changes such as this one .

set approval process locks and unlocks with apex code new lock ( )  and unlock ( )  methods in the system .
approval  namespace let you lock records by passing in record ids or sobjects .
previously , you could set approval - process locks and unlocks only through the salesforce user interface .
set recipients of email notifications for unhandled apex exceptions configure email addresses that receive emails when your apex code encounters unhandled exceptions .
previously , these emails were sent only to the developer who ’d last modified a failing class or trigger .
now you can also notify users of your salesforce org and arbitrary email addresses .
improve performance and reliability with platform cache utilize the new force.com platform caching layer to cache salesforce session and org data for faster performance and better reliability .
the cache  namespace in apex lets you specify what to cache and for how long , without needing to use custom objects and settings or overloading a visualforce viewstate .
also use org partitions to improve performance by distributing cache space so some apps or operations do n’t steal capacity from others .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
reorder your batch jobs in the flex queue programmatically apex methods in the new system .
flexqueue  class enable you to automate the prioritization of batch jobs in the apex flex queue .
previously , you could reorder jobs in the flex queue only from the salesforce user interface .
new methods in the system .
test  class enable you to enqueue no - operation batch jobs in a test version of your batch queue and flex queue .
make unlimited concurrent callouts to internal salesforce urls you can now make unlimited concurrent callouts to endpoints in your salesforce org ’s domain .
you no longer need to live in fear of hitting limits when you set up cross - org integrations to synchronize data between your orgs .
you can also make unlimited callouts back into your own org to access the metadata api , use describelayout ( ) , and so on .
make calls to pagereference.getcontent ( ) in asynchronous apex you can now make calls to the getcontent ( )  and getcontentaspdf ( )  methods of the pagereference  class from within asynchronous apex such as batch apex , schedulable  and queueable  classes , and @future  methods .
this allows you to design much more flexible and scalable services that , for example , render visualforce pages as pdf files .
receive
more consistent , clear results for tests containing callouts callouts , including the getcontent ( )  methods of pagereference , are n’t supported in apex tests .
previously , test methods that contain callouts were skipped .
to receive mock responses in test methods , use webservicemock , staticresourcecalloutmock , multistaticresourcecalloutmock , and test.setmock .
view apex hammer execution status ( generally available ) salesforce runs your organization ’s apex tests in both the current and new release , and compares the results to quickly identify issues for you .
catch exceptions for excess enqueued batch jobs we ’ve changed the type of exception that ’s thrown when you try to enqueue too many batch jobs from an uncatchable limitexception  to a catchable asyncexception .
this exception type change affects api version 35.0 and later .
397 salesforce winter ’16 release notes apex code serialize and deserialize json objects reliably we ’ve made improvements to the json serialization and deserialization process for map and string objects .
we also fixed a bug in equality checks for ids after roundtrip serialization .
sort long and short ids
together in apex lists when you use sort ( )  methods on list < id > s that contain both 15-character case - sensitive ids and 18-character case - safe ids , ids for the same record now sort together .
we ’ve fixed this bug in api version 35.0 and later . split
( ) methods return extra list items in old api versions changes introduced by oracle in the java™ platform , standard edition 8 , affect some salesforce behaviors .
for example , a zero - width match at the beginning of a split ( )  method ’s input sequence produces an extra list item at the beginning of the method ’s output .
however , we ’ve corrected this split ( )  method behavior in api version 35.0 and later .
new and changed apex classes these classes , methods , annotations , and interfaces are new or have changed in this release .
set approval process locks and unlocks with apex code new lock ( )  and unlock ( )  methods in the system .
approval  namespace let you lock records by passing in record ids or sobjects .
previously , you could set approval - process locks and unlocks only through the salesforce user interface .
to enable this feature , from setup , enter process automation settings  in the quick find  box , then click process automation settings .
then , select enable record locking and unlocking in apex .
salesforce admins can edit locked records .
depending on your approval process configuration settings , an assigned approver can also edit locked records .
locks and unlocks that are set programmatically use the same record editability settings as other approval - process locks and unlocks .
record locks and unlocks are treated as dml .
they ’re blocked before a callout , they count toward your dml limits , and if a failure occurs , they ’re rolled back along with the rest of your transaction .
to change this rollback behavior , use an allornone parameter .
the new approval .
lockresult and approval .
unlockresult classes let you interact with the results of your programmatic record locks and unlocks .
example : // query the accounts to lock account [ ] accts = [ select i d from account where name like ' acme% ' ] ; //

set recipients of email notifications for unhandled apex exceptions configure email addresses that receive emails when your apex code encounters unhandled exceptions .
previously , these emails were sent only to the developer who ’d last modified a failing class or trigger .
now you can also notify users of your salesforce org and arbitrary email addresses .
unhandled exception emails are sent by default to the developer specified in the lastmodifiedby  field on the failing class or trigger .
in addition , you can have emails sent to users of your salesforce org and to arbitrary email addresses .
to set up these email notifications , from setup , enter apex exception email  in the quick find  box , then select apex exception email .
you can also configure apex exception emails using the tooling api object apexemailnotification .

improve performance and reliability with platform cache utilize the new force.com platform caching layer to cache salesforce session and org data for faster performance and better reliability .
the cache  namespace in apex lets you specify what to cache and for how long , without needing to use custom objects and settings or overloading a visualforce viewstate .
also use org partitions to improve performance by distributing cache space so some apps or operations do n’t steal capacity from others .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
there are two types of cache : • session cache — stores data for individual user sessions .
for example , in an app that finds customers within specified territories , the calculations that run while users browse different locations on a map are reused .
a session cache lives alongside a user session .
the maximum life of a session is eight hours .
a session cache expires when its specified time - to - live ( ttlsecs  value ) is reached or when the session expires after eight hours , whichever comes first . •
org cache — stores data that any user in an org reuses .
for example , the contents of navigation bars that dynamically display menu items based on user profile are reused .
unlike a session cache , an org cache is accessible across sessions , requests , and org users and profiles .
an org cache expires when its specified time - to - live ( ttlsecs  value ) is reached .
session data is cached alongside user sessions .
org data is accessible across sessions , requests , and org users .
the session cache expires when its specified time - to - live ( ttlsecs  value ) is reached , or when the session expires , whichever comes first .
because apex runs in a multitenant environment with cached data living alongside internally cached data , there ’s minimal disruption to core salesforce processes .
easily set up and manage partitions with the platform cache partition tool in setup , without using apex code .
use the tool to create or remove cache partitions , and allocate their cache capacities to balance performance across apps .
the tool displays a snapshot of all partitions with their allotted capacities , and lets you reallocate space as needed . 399 salesforce winter ’16 release notes apex code note :  to use caching , you need at least one partition in your org .
optionally , create multiple partitions and designate one as the default partition .
to access the partition tool in setup , enter platform cache  in the quick find  box , then select platform cache .
the cache  namespace includes classes and methods for managing your org ’s cache space programmatically .
use five specialized apex classes to : • add , retrieve , and manage values in the session cache or the org cache . •
manage cache values in the org cache of a specific partition .
• manage cache values in the session cache of a specific partition . •
get a specific partition in order to perform cache operations . •
perform cache operations on a default partition without having to use fully qualified key references .
for information about managing cache space and behavior with apex , see the force.com apex code developer ’s guide .
for information about the new metadata api type for partitions , see the metadata api developer ’s guide .

flexqueue  class enable you to automate the prioritization of batch jobs in the apex flex queue .
previously , you could reorder jobs in the flex queue only from the salesforce user interface .
new methods in the system .
test  class enable you to enqueue no - operation batch jobs in a test version of your batch queue and flex queue .
you can place up to 100 batch jobs in a holding status for future execution .
when system resources become available , the jobs are taken from the top of the apex flex queue and moved to the batch job queue .
up to five queued or active jobs can be processed simultaneously for each org .
when a job is moved out of the flex queue for processing , its status changes from holding to queued .
queued jobs are executed when the system is ready to process new jobs .
this example moves a job in the flex queue so that it is executed immediately before the specified job in the queue .
to move the job , call the system .
flexqueue.movebeforejob ( )  method and pass it both jobs’ ids .
id jobtomoveid = system.enqueuejob(new myqueueableclass ( ) ) ; asyncapexjob a = [ select i d from asyncapexjob where apexclassid in ( select i d from apexclass where namespaceprefix = null and name = ' batchjob ' ) ] ) ; id jobinqueueid = a .

you no longer need to live in fear of hitting limits when you set up cross - org integrations to synchronize data between your orgs .
you can also make unlimited callouts back into your own org to access the metadata api , use describelayout ( ) , and so on .
previously , you could make only 20 simultaneous requests to urls within one host , including to urls within your org ’s domain .
that limit has been lifted for internal urls .
however , you can still make only 100 total callouts in a transaction , including to internal urls .
pagereference.getcontent ( )  callouts to visualforce pages are exempt from the per - transaction limit .
see also : make calls to pagereference.getcontent ( ) in asynchronous apex make calls to pagereference.getcontent ( ) in asynchronous apex you can now make calls to the getcontent ( )  and getcontentaspdf ( )  methods of the pagereference  class from within asynchronous apex such as batch apex , schedulable  and queueable  classes , and @future  methods .
this allows you to design much more flexible and scalable services that , for example , render visualforce pages as pdf files .
for the purposes of limits and restrictions , calls to getcontent ( )  ( and getcontentaspdf ( ) , which behaves the same ) are treated as callouts .
the behavior and restrictions vary depending on the pagereference  it ’s called on , and in certain cases are relaxed .
there are three different possibilities .
pagereference  instances that explicitly reference a visualforce page for example , page.existingpagename .
calls to getcontent ( )  are n’t subject to either the maximum concurrent callouts limit or the maximum total callouts per transaction limit .
additionally , only pagereference instances that reference a visualforce page can call getcontent ( )  from scheduled apex , that is , apex classes that implement the schedulable  interface . pagereference  instances that reference a salesforce url for example , pagereference('/ ' + recordid ) .
calls to getcontent ( )  for salesforce urls are n’t subject to the maximum concurrent callouts limit , but they are subject to the maximum total callouts per transaction limit .
you ca n’t call getcontent ( )  for salesforce urls from within scheduled apex .
pagereference  instances that reference an external url for example , pagereference('https://www.google.com/ ' ) .
calls to getcontent ( )  for external urls are subject to both the maximum concurrent callouts limit and the maximum total callouts per transaction limit .
you ca n’t call getcontent ( )  for external urls from within scheduled apex .
note :  even when calls to getcontent ( )  and getcontentaspdf ( )  are n’t tracked against callout limits , they ’re still subject to the usual apex limits such as cpu time , etc .
these limits are cumulative across all callouts within the originating transaction .
finally , we ’ve relaxed the restrictions on calling getcontent ( )  and getcontentaspdf ( )  after performing dml operations ( excluding creating savepoints ) .
if the calls to getcontent ( )  and getcontentaspdf ( )  are internal calls , they ’re now allowed .
401 salesforce winter ’16 release notes apex code external callouts after dml operations are still blocked , and you still ca n’t make callouts from within getcontent ( )  calls themselves , that is , during the rendering of the page .

many chatter rest api resource actions are exposed as static methods on apex classes in the connectapi  namespace .
these methods use other connectapi  classes to input and return information .
the connectapi  namespace is referred to as chatter in apex .
in apex , it ’s possible to access some chatter data using soql queries and objects .
however , connectapi  classes expose chatter data in a much simpler way .
data is localized and structured for display .
for example , instead of making many calls to access and assemble a feed , you can do it with a single call .
note :  to integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third party web applications with chatter and communities , use chatter rest api .

lightning components
the lightning component framework powers salesforce1 .
use the framework to build mobile apps and pages faster than ever in lightning experience , salesforce1 , salesforce classic , and communities .
use out - of - the - box components or build your own components with javascript , html , css , apex , or any web - enabled code .
the appexchange for components enables you to install components created by salesforce partners or publish your own components .
for more information , refer to the lightning components developer ’s guide .

lightning components ( generally available ) we ’re thrilled to announce that lightning components are now generally available across all salesforce - supported platforms .
whether you ’re developing for the desktop or for salesforce1 , lightning components help you quickly build beautiful applications .
also , since lightning components were designed with the lightning experience in mind , your components integrate seamlessly into the new salesforce user interface .
enable my domain
to use lightning components for security purposes , lightning components now require you to define a custom salesforce domain name for your organization .
if you ’re using lightning components today , you might need to take action to avoid having lightning components - based customizations disabled when winter ’16 is released .
if you ’re using lightning components to create : 427 salesforce winter ’16 release notes lightning components • lightning tabs • lightning pages ( formerly flexipages ) , for example , in lightning app builder • standalone apps
and you do n’t have my domain enabled for your organization , your lightning tabs , components , and pages will be disabled when your organization is upgraded to winter ’16 .
if you participated in the lightning components for salesforce1 beta , you can temporarily re - enable your customizations by enabling this update in the critical update console .
with this update , references and links to lightning components , applications , and documentation that use non - customized https://lightning.force.com  urls continue to work .
note :  this critical update behaves differently than normal critical updates .
the actual change in behavior is automatically applied to your org immediately in winter ’16 .
the critical update , when enabled , allows you to temporarily revert to the old behavior .
but just like the snooze button on your alarm clock , it ’s a temporary reprieve .
when the auto - activation date arrives , the change in behavior will be enforced in all organizations , regardless of the setting for the critical update itself .
if you did n’t participate in the lightning components for salesforce1 beta , you do n’t have access to this critical update .
if you ’re affected by this change , contact salesforce for assistance .
the correct long - term solution for this change is to enable my domain for your organization .
if you do this before your org is upgraded to winter ’16 you can avoid the issue entirely .
when you enable my domain , references and links to lightning resources are in the format https://<mydomain>.lightning.force.com .
there are many benefits to creating a custom domain for your organization beyond enabling lightning components .
if you ’re not already using a custom domain name , refer to the “ guidelines and best practices for implementing my domain ” and related online help .
finally , you do n’t need to enable my domain to use lightning components in the following contexts . •

new components the following component is new .
force : canvasapp the force : canvasapp  component allows you to create lightning components that include a force.com canvas application .
changed components the following components have changed attributes or styling for salesforce1 , lightning experience , and standalone apps .
ui : button the uibutton -- neutral  class has been added to the < button >  tag .
this change does n’t apply to standalone apps .
428 salesforce winter ’16 release notes lightning components ui : input the uiinput -- default  and uiinput -- input  classes have been added to the < div >  tag that wraps the < input > tag .
the < input >  tag now contains only the input  class .
these changes apply to all components that extend ui : input , such as ui : inputtext  and ui : inputdate .
ui : inputcheckbox
the uiinput -- default and uiinput -- checkbox classes have been added to the < div > tag that wraps the < input > tag .
ui : inputdate
the following classes have been added to the < div >  tag that wraps the < input >  tag : uiinput -- default , uiinput -- input , uiinput -- datetime .
the uidatepicker -- default  class has been added to the date picker in this component .
depending on the form factor , the date picker has one of the following classes : phone , tablet , desktop .
additionally , the placeholder text displays only when the date picker is not available , when displaydatepicker"false " .
to assist with user input , the placeholder text displays based on the browser locale , such as mmm d , yyyy .
ui : inputdatetime
the following classes have been added to the < div >  tag that wraps the < input >  tag : uiinput -- default , uiinput -- input , uiinput -- datetime .
when the form factor is a desktop , this component displays as two separate date and time fields .
these fields are wrapped in a < form >  tag with the form -- stacked  class .
depending on the form factor , the date picker has one of the following classes : phone , tablet , desktop .
the time picker displays as a scrollable menu that provides the time in 30-minute increments .
additionally , the placeholder text displays only when the date picker is not available , when displaydatepicker"false " .
to assist with user input , the placeholder text displays based on the browser locale , such as mmm d , yyyy  for the date field and h : mm a  for the time field .
ui : outputcheckbox the altchecked  and altunchecked  attributes contain the default values true  and false respectively .
ui : outputrichtext
these html tags are no longer supported : < object > , < iframe > , < embed > , < form > , < button > , and < input>. a url that ’s passed to the component via the href attribute is now validated and supported only for http://  and https:// prefixes .
for example , passing < div>&lt;a href='javascript : alert(1)'&gt;click here!&lt;/a&gt;</div >  to ui : outputrichtext  fails validation and aborts the rendering process .
unescaped comments that are passed to the component are removed .
for example , passing <
div>&lt;!--comment--&gt;&lt;img src = x onerror='alert(1)'&gt;</div >  to ui : outputrichtext  removes & lt;!--comment--&gt ;  from the payload .
the css expression ( )  directive is no longer supported for microsoft internet explorer .
new interfaces the following interfaces are new .
force : hasrecordid
the force : hasrecordid interface is useful for record home components .
implement this interface if you want your component to receive the id of the currently displaying record .
force : hassobjectname
the force : hassobjectname  interface is useful for record home components .
implement this interface if your component needs to know the api name of the object of the currently displaying record .
429 salesforce winter ’16 release notes lightning components lightning events events add a layer of interaction to your components .
the following ui  event is now available .
event name ui : menufocuschange description indicates that the user changed menu item focus in a menu component .
other changes in lightning components we ’ve made additional changes in lightning components .
in
this section : slimmed down the javascript api doc in a patch for the summer ’15 release in july , we filtered the javascript api section of the reference doc app to only show the methods that you need to build lightning components .
this is a reminder to only use the set of supported methods .
we are not guaranteeing support for code that uses unsupported methods .
component event bubbling component event bubbling is similar to standard event bubbling in browsers .
when a component event is fired , the component that fired the event can handle it .
the event then bubbles up and can be handled by a component in the containment hierarchy that receives the bubbled event .
improved responsiveness with multiple requests the framework can now execute more than one request ( xhr ) in parallel .
previously , the framework only processed one request at a time .
improved default value initialization for array , list , and set attributes you can use array syntax ( [ ] ) to initialize default values for attributes of type list  or set  or arrays of basic types .
simplified input component error handling the javascript api for handling field - level errors for input components has been simplified so that it ’s easier to set and handle errors .
the change isolates error handling into the handful of input components that require it .
call component methods with < aura : method > use < aura : method >  to define a method as part of a component 's api .
this enables you to directly call a method in a component ’s client - side controller instead of firing and handling a component event .
using < aura : method >  simplifies the code needed for a parent component to call a method on a child component that it contains .
browser console warnings for access check violations if you access a resource , such as a component or attribute , that does n’t have an access  system attribute allowing you to access it , you ’ll see a warning in your browser console .
the framework will enforce these access checks more strictly in a later release so you should n’t ignore them .
use $ a.getcallback ( ) instead of $ a.run ( ) $ a.run ( ) is deprecated .
use $ a.getcallback ( ) to wrap any code that accesses a component outside the normal rerendering lifecycle , such as in a settimeout ( )  call .
this enables the framework to grant the correct access level to the asynchronous code .
set default values on attributes in design files you can now set a default value on an attribute in design files that are part of component bundles for the lightning app builder . 430 salesforce winter ’16 release notes lightning components add an app launcher component in lightning app builder include navigation between apps for your lightning app users .
add a wave dashboard component in lightning app builder ( pilot ) embedding wave analytics dashboard component on a lightning home or record page provides an interactive visualization of your data .
users can drill in and explore the dashboard within the frame on the lightning page or in a wave analytics window .
make your lightning components available for lightning experience include your components in the app launcher for lightning experience users .
make your lightning components available for communities enable administrators to drag and drop custom lightning components in community builder by following these guidelines .
assign versions to your components component versioning lets you declare dependencies against specific revisions of an installed managed package .
add lightning components to visualforce pages integrate lightning components into visualforce pages for a dynamic development experience .
slimmed down the javascript api doc in a patch for the summer ’15 release in july , we filtered the javascript api section of the reference doc app to only show the methods that you need to build lightning components .
this is a reminder to only use the set of supported methods .
we are not guaranteeing support for code that uses unsupported methods .
previously , the javascript api doc was showing many objects and methods that should only be used internally in the framework code so it was promoting anti - patterns for developers .
access the reference doc app at : https://<mysalesforceinstance>.lightning.force.com / auradocs / reference.app , where < mysalesforceinstance >  is the name of the instance hosting your org ; for example , na1
. component event bubbling component event bubbling is similar to standard event bubbling in browsers .
when a component event is fired , the component that fired the event can handle it .
the event then bubbles up and can be handled by a component in the containment hierarchy that receives the bubbled event .
previously component events could only be handled by the component that fired the event or by a parent component that contained the component .
the addition of component event bubbling makes component events much more powerful and intuitive for developers .
event bubbling rules a component event ca n't be handled by every parent in the containment hierarchy .
instead , it bubbles to every facet value provider in the containment hierarchy .
a facet value provider is the outermost component containing the markup that references the component firing the event .
confused ?
it makes more sense when you look at an example .
c : eventbubblingparent contains c : eventbubblingchild , which in turn contains c : eventbubblinggrandchild .
< !
--c : eventbubblingparent-- > < aura : component > < c : eventbubblinggrandchild / > < /c : eventbubblingchild > < c : eventbubblingchild > < /aura : component > 431
salesforce winter ’16 release notes lightning components if c : eventbubblinggrandchild  fires a component event , it can handle the event itself .
the event then bubbles up the containment hierarchy .
c : eventbubblingchild  contains c : eventbubblinggrandchild  but it 's not the facet value provider as it 's not the outermost component in the markup so it ca n't handle the bubbled event .
c : eventbubblingparent  is the facet value provider as c : eventbubblingchild  is in its markup .
c : eventbubblingparent  can handle the event .
handle bubbled event a component that fires a component event registers that it fires the event by using the < aura : registerevent > tag .
< aura : component > < aura : registerevent name="bubblingevent " type="c : compevent " / > < /aura : component >
a component handling the bubbled component event uses the < aura : handler >  tag to assign a handling action in its client - side controller .
< aura : component > < aura : handler name="bubblingevent " event="c : compevent " action="{!c.handlebubbling}"/ > < /aura : component > note :  the name  attribute in < aura : handler >  must match the name  attribute in the < aura : registerevent >  tag in the component that fires the event .
for more information , see the lightning components developer ’s guide .
improved responsiveness with multiple requests the framework can now execute more than one request ( xhr ) in parallel .
previously , the framework only processed one request at a time .
the framework automatically throttles requests and it 's not user controlled .
the framework manages the number of requests , which varies depending on available resources .
as in previous releases , multiple queued actions are batched in a single request ( xhr ) to minimize network traffic .
improved default value initialization for array , list , and set attributes you can use array syntax ( [ ] ) to initialize default values for attributes of type list  or set  or arrays of basic types .
this example sets default values for attributes of type string [ ] , list , and set .
< aura : attribute name="colorpalettearray " type="string [ ] " default="['red ' , ' green ' , ' blue ' ] " / > < aura : attribute name="colorpalettelist " type="list " default="['red ' , ' green ' , ' blue ' ] " / > < aura : attribute name="colorpaletteset " type="set " default="['red ' , ' green ' , ' blue ' ] " / >
previously , you could only use a comma - separated list , such as default="red , green , blue " , to set default values for these types .
this syntax still works but can cause unexpected issues as leading and trailing whitespace is preserved for each item .
use the array syntax instead .
simplified input component error handling the javascript api for handling field - level errors for input components has been simplified so that it ’s easier to set and handle errors .
the change isolates error handling into the handful of input components that require it .
this table summarizes the updated patterns for working with input component errors . 432 salesforce winter ’16 release notes lightning components old method call cmp.adderrors("v.value " , errors ) cmp.geterrors("v.value " , errors ) cmp.clearerrors("v.value " ) cmp.setvalid("v.value " , true ) cmp.setvalid("v.value " , false ) cmp.isvalid("v.value " ) replacement method call cmp.set("v.errors " , errors ) cmp.get("v.errors " ) cmp.set("v.errors " , null ) cmp.set("v.errors " , null )
no longer needed $ a.util.isempty(cmp.get("v.errors " ) )
if you use custom error handling with input components , you no longer have to manually fire the onerror , onclearerrors , or updateerror  events .
the framework automatically fires and handles the events depending on the value in the errors  attribute .
call component methods with < aura : method > use < aura : method >  to define a method as part of a component 's api .
this enables you to directly call a method in a component ’s client - side controller instead of firing and handling a component event .
using < aura : method >  simplifies the code needed for a parent component to call a method on a child component that it contains .
for more information , see the lightning components developer ’s guide .
browser console warnings for access check violations if you access a resource , such as a component or attribute , that does n’t have an access  system attribute allowing you to access it , you ’ll see a warning in your browser console .
the framework will enforce these access checks more strictly in a later release so you should n’t ignore them .
the framework enables you to control access to your applications , interfaces , components , attributes , and events via the access system attribute on these tags : aura : application , aura : interface , aura : component , aura : attribute , and aura : event .
the default value for all these resources is access="public " , which means the resources are only available within the same namespace .
for more information about the access  system attribute , see the lightning components developer ’s guide .
fixing access check warnings fix any access check warnings using one or more of these techniques : • add appropriate access  system attributes to the resources that you own • remove references in your code to resources that are not available • ensure that any attribute that you ’re accessing exists and that you ’re using the correct spelling .
undefined attributes trigger the same access violation as accessing a private attribute .
the message is the same because the access context does n’t know whether the attribute exists or is undefined .
• use $ a.getcallback ( )  to wrap any code that accesses a component outside the normal rerendering lifecycle , such as in a settimeout ( ) or setinterval ( ) call or in an es6 promise .
$ a.getcallback ( )  preserves the current execution context and grants the correct access level to the asynchronous code .
otherwise , the framework loses context and only allows access to global resources .
433 salesforce winter ’16 release notes lightning components use $ a.getcallback ( ) instead of $ a.run ( ) $ a.run ( )  is deprecated .
use $ a.getcallback ( )  to wrap any code that accesses a component outside the normal rerendering lifecycle , such as in a settimeout ( )  call .
this enables the framework to grant the correct access level to the asynchronous code .
set default values on attributes in design files you can now set a default value on an attribute in design files that are part of component bundles for the lightning app builder .
example : < design : attribute name="name " datasource="value1,value2,value3 " default=”value1 ” / > add an app launcher component in lightning app builder include navigation between apps for your lightning app users .
the lightning app builder now includes the app launcher component you can drag onto any page .
the app launcher displays all of a user ’s available salesforce apps , as well as any connected apps the administrator configures .
users navigate between apps using the app launcher .
contact salesforce to enable the app launcher component for the lightning app builder in your organization .
add a wave dashboard component in lightning app builder ( pilot ) embedding wave analytics dashboard component on a lightning home or record page provides an interactive visualization of your data .
users can drill in and explore the dashboard within the frame on the lightning page or in a wave analytics window .
the component allows you to control the visibility of the dashboard ’s title and to specify whether the dashboard appears on the page if an error occurs .
with the open links in new windows attribute , you can specify where links from the dashboard to other wave analytics assets are opened .
with the filter attribute , you can use json to filter dataset fields at run time .
for example : { datasetdevelopername1:{field1:[value]},datasetdevelopername1:{field1:[value1,value2],field2:["value3 , with comma " ] } } note :  wave analytics for the lightning app builder is in pilot .
contact your salesforce account executive to enable this feature .
make your lightning components available for lightning experience include your components in the app launcher for lightning experience users .
in the components you wish to include in lightning experience , add implements="force : apphostable "  in the aura : component  tag and save your changes .
< aura : component implements="force : apphostable " > the apphostable  interface makes the component available as a custom tab .
follow these steps to include your components in lightning experience and make them available to users in your organization . 1 .
create a custom tab for this component .
a.
from setup , enter tabs  in the quick find  box , then select tabs .
b. click new in the lightning component tabs related list . c. select the lightning component that you want to make available to users .
434 salesforce winter ’16 release notes lightning components d. enter a label to display on the tab .
e. select the tab style and click next .
f. when prompted to add the tab to profiles , accept the default and click save . 2 .
add your lightning components to the app launcher .
a.
from setup , enter apps  in the quick find  box , then select apps .
b. click new .
select custom app  and then click next . c. enter lightning  for app labeland click next .
d. in the available tabs  dropdown menu , select the lightning component tab you created and click the right arrow button to add it to the custom app .
e. click next .
select the visible  checkbox to assign the app to profiles and then save . 3 . check your output by navigating to the app launcher in lightning experience .
your custom app should appear in theapp launcher .
click the custom app to see the components you added .
for more information on creating custom apps , see “
creating custom apps ” in the salesforce help .
make your lightning components available for communities enable administrators to drag and drop custom lightning components in community builder by following these guidelines .
add a new interface to your component to appear in the community builder , a component must implement the forcecommunity : availableforallpagetypes interface .
here ’s the sample code for a simple “ hello world ” component .
< aura : component implements="forcecommunity : availableforallpagetypes " > < aura : attribute name="greeting " type="string " default="hello " / > < aura : attribute name="subject " type="string " default="world " / > < div style="box " > < span class="greeting">{!v.greeting}</span > , { ! v.subject }
! < /div > <
/aura : component > note :  as access checks will be more strictly enforced in a later release , mark your resources with access="global " now to make the resource usable outside of your own org ; for example , if you want the resource to be usable in an installed package or by a lightning app builder user or a community builder user in another org .
add a design resource to your component bundle a design resource describes the design - time behavior of a lightning component — information that visual tools need to allow adding the component to a page or app .
to make an attribute available for administrators to edit in the community builder , add a design : attribute  node for the attribute into the design resource .
an attribute marked as required in the component definition automatically appears for users in the community builder , unless it has a default value assigned to it .
required attributes with default values and attributes not marked as required in the component definition must be specified in the design resource or they wo n’t appear for users . 435 salesforce winter ’16 release notes lightning components here ’s the design resource that goes in the bundle with the “ hello world ” component .
< design : component label="hello communities " > < design : attribute name="subject " label="subject " description="name of the person you want to greet " / > < design : attribute name="greeting " label="greeting " / > < /design : component > to render a field as a picklist , add a datasource  onto the attribute in the design resource , like this : < design : attribute name="name " datasource="value1,value2,value3 " / > any string attribute with a datasource  in a design resource is treated as a picklist .
you can set a default value on an attribute in a design resource , like this : < design : attribute name="name " datasource="value1,value2,value3 " default="value1 " / > note :  a design resource supports only attributes of type int , string , or boolean .
design resources must be named componentname.design .
assign versions to your components component versioning lets you declare dependencies against specific revisions of an installed managed package .
by assigning a version to your component , you have granular control over how the component functions when new versions of a managed package are released .
for example , imagine that a < packagenamespace>:button  is pinned to version 2.0 of the package .
upon installing version 3.0 , the button retains its version 2.0 functionality .
note :  the package developer is responsible for inserting versioning logic into the markup when updating a component .
if the component was n’t changed in the update or if the markup does n’t account for version , the component behaves in the context of the most recent version .
versions are assigned declaratively in the developer console .
when you ’re working on a component , click bundle version settings in the right panel to define the version .
you can only version a component if you ’ve installed a package , and the valid versions for the component are the available versions of that package .
versions are in the format < major>.<minor>.
so if you assign a component version 1.4 , its behavior depends on the first major release and fourth minor release of the associated package .
add lightning components to visualforce pages integrate lightning components into visualforce pages for a dynamic development experience .
436 salesforce winter ’16 release notes api you only have to use a few lines of visualforce markup to get up and running with lightning components for visualforce .
< apex : page > < apex : includelightning / > < div id="lightning " / > < script > $ lightning.use("c : lcvftest " , function ( ) { $ lightning.createcomponent("ui : button " , { label : " press me ! " } , " lightning " , function(cmp ) { // do some stuff } ) ; } ) ; < /script

search suggested records vxx.x / search / suggestions?q = search string&sobject = object type the resource that auto - suggests records before you perform a full search was expanded with filters for groups , communities , topics , and users .
the following request parameters were added : • fields • groupid
• networkid •
topicid • type • userid • where the requested lookup fields’ values are returned in the response as part of the attributes element .
in the absence of a standard name or title response field , the main identifying field is used .
for example , in cases , the case number is used .
notes about usage and examples were updated to reflect current functionality .
new and changed headers for cache validation we ’ve enhanced support for cache validation through the introduction of http entity tags ( etag ) on sobject rows results and two request headers that leverage them , if - match  and if - none - match .
we ’ve also added a new , time - based validation request header , if - unmodified - since , and expanded support for if - modified - since .
etag the etag  header is a response header that ’s returned when you access the sobject rows resource .
it ’s a hash of the content that ’s used by the if - match  and if - none - match  request headers in subsequent requests to determine if the content has changed .
example request : /v35.0/sobjects
/ account/001d000000lfhvhiad example response header : etag : " u5iwijwwbqd18jeixwsqxegpzqk =- gzip " etag  is supported only for account records . if - match the if - match  header is a request header for sobject rows that includes a list of etags .
if the etag of the record you ’re requesting matches any etag specified in the header , the request is processed .
otherwise , a 412 precondition failed  status code is returned , and the request is n’t processed .
for example , let ’s say you attempt to update the record from the previous example .
in the request , if you include the if - match  header with the etag returned in the previous response , the record is updated .
example request header : if - match : " jbjuzw7dbhaeg3fd90kjbx6a0ow =- gzip " , " u5iwijwwbqd18jeixwsqxegpzqk =- gzip " 448 salesforce winter ’16 release notes api example response : http/1.1 204 no content record is updated
but if you include the if - match  header without the returned etag , the record is n’t updated . example request header : if - match : " jbjuzw7dbhaeg3fd90kjbx6a0ow =- gzip " example response : http/1.1 412 precondition failed if - match  is supported only for account records . if - none - match the if - none - match  header is a request header for sobject rows that ’s the inverse of if - match .
if the etag of the record you ’re requesting matches any etag specified in the header , the request is n’t processed .
a 304 not modified  status code is returned for get or head requests , and a 412 precondition failed  status code is returned for patch requests .
for example , let ’s say you attempt to get the record data from the etag  example .
if you include the if - none - match  header with the etag returned in the response , a 304 not modified  status code is returned .
example request header : if - none - match : " jbjuzw7dbhaeg3fd90kjbx6a0ow =- gzip " , " u5iwijwwbqd18jeixwsqxegpzqk =- gzip " example response : http/1.1 304 not modified but if you include the if - none - match header without the etag , the record data is returned .
example request header : if - match : " jbjuzw7dbhaeg3fd90kjbx6a0ow =- gzip " example response : http/1.1 200 ok record data if - none - match  is supported only for account records . if - unmodified - since the if - unmodified - since  header is a request header that ’s the inverse of if - modified - since .
if you make a request and include the if - unmodified - since  header , the request is processed only if the data hasn’t changed since the specified date .
otherwise , a 412 precondition failed  status code is returned , and the request is n’t processed .
the if - unmodified - since header is supported for the same resources that support
if - modified - since .
example request header : if - unmodified - since : tue , 10 aug 2015 00:00:00 gmt if - modified - since the sobject rows , invocable actions , and describe global resources now support the if - modified - since  header .

previously , salesforce was unavailable during these times .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
editions available in :
all editions when salesforce is in read - only mode , you can navigate within the application and view and report on your business data .
during read - only mode , you ca n’t : • add , edit , or delete data • perform any actions in salesforce that modify your salesforce data .
for example : – post on chatter – use liveagent – refresh dashboards – perform api write or edit actions – perform bulk api read actions –
save new or edited reports note :  you can still run existing reports .
activity reminders do n’t occur , and recent items lists do n’t update .
login history is still recorded for compliance purposes , but it is n’t reflected in your organization until a few minutes after the organization exits read - only mode .
when your organization is in read - only mode , desktop and mobile browser users see a banner at the top of their browser window : 487 salesforce winter ’16 release notes run asynchronous soql queries ( pilot ) if a user tries to perform an action that is n’t available in read - only mode , an error message notifies them that salesforce is read - only .
after the maintenance is complete , users are prompted to log in again .
see also : when to expect read - only mode run asynchronous soql queries ( pilot ) async soql is a method for running soql queries in the background over salesforce entity data , including sobjects , bigobjects , and external objects ( accessed via lightning connect ) .
it provides a convenient way to query large amounts of data stored in salesforce .
note :  async soql is available to select customers through a pilot program .
for information on joining the pilot program , contact your salesforce account executive .
with the advent of bigobjects , it ’s possible to keep billions of records on the platform .
salesforce has made new platform services available to help you work at this new scale , by combining bigobject data with your core business data .
editions available in : • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer async soql is implemented in the form of a restful api that enables you to run queries in the familiar syntax of the soql language .
you can run multiple queries in parallel , and monitor their completion status .
each query runs in the background , and the results are deposited into an object you specify , which can be an sobject or bigobject .
as a result , you can subset , join , and create more complex queries that are not subject to timeout limits .
this is ideal when you have millions or billions of records , and need more performant processing than is possible with synchronous soql .
for more information , see the async soql guide .
async soql versus data pipelines async soql is related to data pipelines , but is focused on object - level segmentation , aggregation , and filtering , and does not allow you to interact with salesforce files .
the figure below compares the two methods .
488 salesforce winter ’16 release notes field audit trail supports additional objects to use async soql effectively , it ’s helpful to understand its key components and other related concepts .
why would you use an asynchronous soql query instead of standard soql ?
the following table lists the key decision criteria across the broadest array of use cases .
reasons for reliability resilience scale reasons against immediacy of result user experience < 50 m scale field audit trail supports additional objects you can set field audit trail policies on additional objects .
this extends the types of data whose field history you can archive .
the following additional objects are now supported . •
assets • entitlements •
service contracts • contract line items • solutions • products • price books editions available in : • developer • enterprise • unlimited • performance 489 salesforce winter ’16 release notes set audit fields and update records with inactive owners set audit fields and update records with inactive owners migrating data to salesforce and mass updating records just got easier .
now you can set audit fields when you create records through the api and update records with inactive owners without contacting salesforce .
for some scenarios , you need to set values for fields that are n’t normally editable , for example , when migrating data to salesforce .
in that situation , it ’s often preferable to replace the salesforce record creation date with the date on which the record was created in the original system .
or when working with a record that has an inactive owner , you often want to change ownership of the record to an active owner . editions available in : • developer • enterprise • unlimited • performance for common objects , we ’ve added two user permissions to cover these scenarios , which previously required that you contact salesforce .
set audit fields upon record creation set audit fields , such as created by and last modified
by , when you create a record ( api only ) . update records with inactive owners update owner and sharing - based fields on records with inactive owners .
the “ set audit fields upon record creation ” permission is supported for the following objects : account , articleversion , attachment , campaignmember , case , casecomment , contact , contentversion , contract , event , idea , ideacomment , lead , opportunity , question , task , vote , and all custom objects .
the “ update records with inactive owners ” permission is supported for the following objects : account , asset , case , contact , lead , note , opportunity , order , personaccount , servicecontract , salesteam , and all custom objects .
because these permissions give users the power to alter sensitive record data , we ’ve placed them behind an organization preference called “
enable set audit fields upon record creation and update records with inactive owners .
” to enable the user permissions , first enable the organization preference on the user interface page .
from setup , enter user interface  in the quick find  box , then select user interface .
after you enable the organization preference , enable one or both of the user permissions in a permission set or profile .
you can set audit fields only in api - enabled editions of salesforce .
the organization preference defaults to off unless you ’ve previously contacted salesforce to enable the “ create audit fields ” permission , which the organization preference replaces .
