how can i be sure my data is secure in salesforce ?
when you log in , the urls used to access your data are all preceded with https:// instead of http:// , which indicates that a secure connection has been established .
furthermore , whenever your password is changed or reset , or when you log in from a computer you have not used to access salesforce before , you may have to activate your computer to successfully log in to salesforce .
activating your computer allows salesforce to verify your identity and prevent unauthorized access .
13 learn salesforce basics security basics
how can i be sure my data wo n’t be lost ?
we back up your data with a variety of methods to ensure that your organization does not experience any data loss .
every transaction is stored to raid disks in real - time with archive mode enabled , allowing the database to recover all transactions prior to any system failure .
every night all data is backed up to a separate backup server and high speed automatic tape library .
the backup tapes are cloned as an additional precautionary measure , and the cloned tapes are transported to an off - site , fireproof vault twice a month .
in addition , the facility that stores our servers is architecturally designed to withstand catastrophic events and earthquakes up to 8.0 on the richter scale .
how can i be assured my data will be kept private ?
we are committed to keeping your data private and secure .
for a greater understanding of the legal obligations salesforce adheres to regarding data privacy , refer to the privacy statement , as well as the terms of use agreement .

can i automatically back up my data in salesforce ?
yes , weekly export service provides you with .csv files of all objects and attachments within salesforce .

does salesforce use my data for internal purposes ?

what happens when the system goes down ?
salesforce builds redundancy into all systems to minimize system failures that could be perceived as customer outages .
all components are proactively monitored and managed so faults are detected before system outages .
while there may occasionally be system outages due to issues beyond our control , we employ numerous escalation procedures to notify the proper personnel in the event of a system outage , and remedy issues as quickly as possible .
what is read - only mode ?
at salesforce , we recognize that you may want to access your data at a moment ’s notice — even during our planned maintenance windows .
to minimize interruption to your business , salesforce gives users read - only access during splits , instance migrations , instance switches , and certain other maintenance events .
editions available in :

for example : – post on chatter 14 learn salesforce basics security basics – use liveagent – refresh dashboards – perform api write or edit actions – perform bulk api read actions –

activity reminders do n’t occur , and recent items lists do n’t update .
login history is still recorded for compliance purposes , but it is n’t reflected in your organization until a few minutes after the organization exits read - only mode .
when your organization is in read - only mode , desktop and mobile browser users see a banner at the top of their browser window : when to expect read - only mode the maintenance schedule posted on trust.salesforce.com indicates whether each upcoming maintenance window includes read - only access .
planned maintenance windows vary in length depending on the level of maintenance needed .
in addition , when users are notified two weeks before a planned maintenance window , the notification specifies whether the maintenance includes read - only access .

an object is a collection of fields named for the kind of information those fields capture .
commonly - used salesforce objects include contacts , accounts , cases , and reports .
for example , the contacts object contains fields with information describing the people you do business with , such as their first names , last names , phone numbers , business titles , and the companies they work for .
there are two types of salesforce objects .
• standard objects are included with the salesforce license your company purchases .
these are the most commonly - used objects . •
custom objects are created to meet your company ’s business needs .
your organization ’s administrator can customize standard objects or create custom objects to support the type of work your company does or the industry you ’re in .
for example , your organization may choose to create a custom object called “ bugs ” to track their known product issues , or rename the standard object “
accounts ” to “
clients ” because this is how your organization refers to your customers .
in the salesforce interface , you generally work with objects from their tabs .
for example , the opportunity object has an opportunities tab .
if you learn about an object from the salesforce documentation but ca n’t find it in the user interface , contact your administrator to find out whether the object is available to you .
if your edition features objects and related tabs that you ca n’t find documentation for , it may be because the object is custom .

• why did my data disappear when i pressed the backspace key while editing a record ? •
can i change or delete the drop - down list of entries that appears when i edit a text field ?
which languages does salesforce support ? salesforce offers three levels of language support : fully supported languages , end - user languages , and platform - only languages .
each language is identified by a two - character language code , such as en , or a five - character locale code , such as en_au .
note : setting a default locale is different from setting a default language .
in addition to the salesforce language support , you can localize your organizations in two ways .
the translation workbench lets you specify languages you want to translate , assign translators to languages , create translations for customizations you ’ve made to your salesforce organization , and override labels and translations from managed packages .
everything from custom picklist values to custom fields can be translated so your global users can use all of salesforce in their language .
the second option is to rename tabs and fields in salesforce .
if your custom application uses only a few standard salesforce tabs and fields , you can translate them .
fully supported languages you can change the language for all features , including help , to one of the following fully supported languages from setup by entering company information in the quick find box , selecting company information , then selecting edit . • chinese ( simplified ) : zh_cn • chinese ( traditional ) : zh_tw • danish : da • dutch : nl_nl • english : en_us • finnish : fi • french : fr • german : de • italian : it • japanese : ja • korean : ko 48 learn salesforce basics setup faqs • norwegian : no • portuguese ( brazil ) : pt_br • russian : ru • spanish : es • spanish ( mexico ) : es_mx • swedish : sv • thai : th note : • spanish ( mexico ) falls back to spanish for customer - defined translations . •
even though the salesforce user interface is fully translated to thai , help remains in english .
end - user languages end - user languages are useful if you have a multilingual organization or partners who speak languages other than your company ’s default language .
for end - user languages , salesforce provides translated labels for all standard objects and pages , except administrative pages , setup , and help .
when you specify an end - user language , labels and help that are n’t translated appear in english .
end - user languages are intended only for personal use by end users .
do n’t use end - user languages as corporate languages .
salesforce does n’t provide customer support in end - user languages .
end - user languages include : • arabic : ar • bulgarian : bg • croatian : hr • czech : cs • english ( uk ) : en_gb • greek : el • hebrew : iw • hungarian : hu • indonesian : in • polish : pl • portuguese ( portugal ) : pt_pt • romanian : ro • slovak : sk • slovenian : sl • turkish : tr • ukrainian : uk • vietnamese : vi note : salesforce provides limited support for right - to - left languages — arabic and hebrew — for the following features .
• live agent • cases • accounts 49 learn salesforce basics setup faqs
these features are not supported in lightning experience , the salesforce1 mobile app , any other mobile app or mobile browser , or any user interface except salesforce classic .
there is no guarantee that right - to - left languages function correctly with any other salesforce features .
there are no plans to expand the list of supported features .
features that are n’t supported for right - to - left languages include , but are not limited to , the following . • report builder • generating quote pdfs • customizable forecasting • emails • salesforce knowledge • feeds •
communities the absence of a feature from this list does not imply support .
only live agent , cases , and accounts are supported with right - to - left languages .
platform - only languages
in situations where salesforce does n’t provide default translations , use platform - only languages to localize apps and custom functionality that you ’ve built on the salesforce app cloud . you can translate items such as custom labels , custom objects , and field names .
you can also rename most standard objects , labels , and fields .
informative text and non - field label text are n’t translatable .
platform - only languages are available in all places where you can select a language in the application .
however , when you select a platform - only language , all standard salesforce labels default to english or , in select cases , to an end - user or fully supported language
. when you specify a platform - only language , labels for standard objects and fields fall back to english , except : • english ( australia ) , english ( india ) , english ( malaysia ) , and english ( philippines ) fall back to english ( uk ) .
• german ( austria ) and german ( switzerland ) fall back to german .

in professional , enterprise , unlimited , performance , and developer edition organizations , the administrator can define the default sharing model for your organization by setting organization - wide defaults .
organization - wide defaults specify the default level of access to records .
for most objects , organization - wide defaults can be set to private , public read only , or public read / write .

role hierarchies and sharing rules can only be used 86 learn salesforce basics create records to grant additional access — they can not be used to restrict access to records beyond what was originally specified with the sharing model through organization - wide defaults .

what can i do ?
your organization uses duplicate rules , which prevent users from creating duplicate records .
read the message to decide how to proceed .
editions
here ’s what you ’ll see if the record you ’re trying to save is flagged as a possible duplicate .
available in : both salesforce classic and lightning experience available in : • professional • enterprise • performance • unlimited • developer 103 learn salesforce basics records faq 1 .
a system - generated message tells you how many possible duplicates were found .
the number includes only the records you have access to .
if you do n’t have access to any of the records that are identified as possible duplicates , then this message wo n’t include a number but will include a list of record owners so you can request access to the existing duplicates . 2 .
a custom alert written by whoever created the duplicate rule .
ideally , the alert should explain why you ca n’t save the record and what you should do .
3 .
if the duplicate rule allows you to save a record despite it being a possible duplicate , the save ( ignore alert ) button is present .
if the duplicate rule blocks you from saving a record that is a possible duplicate , the save button is present but the record can not be saved successfully until you make the necessary changes to the record so it ’s no longer flagged as a possible duplicate . 4 .
the list of possible duplicates includes only records you have access to .
the fields shown in the list include only fields you have access to ( up to the first 7 fields that were compared and determined to match ) .
a maximum of 5 records are displayed in this list , but if more than 5 duplicates were found , click show all > > to see full list of records , up to 100 .

see also : find your personal settings how do i allow only certain users to share data ?
if your professional , enterprise , unlimited , performance , or developer edition organization has a private or public read only sharing model , your administrator can still allow certain users to share information .
your administrator can create public groups and then set up sharing rules to specify that users in certain roles or groups will always share their data with users in another role or public group .
individual users can also create personal groups to give access to their own accounts , contacts , and opportunities .
can an individual user control the sharing of records they own ?
yes .
in professional , enterprise , unlimited , performance , and developer edition organizations , all account owners are empowered to further extend the sharing on an account - by - account basis .
for example , if the organization has a private model , the acme account owner can share this account and its related data to selected groups , or to individual users .
in enterprise , unlimited , performance , and developer editions , opportunity owners can also extend the sharing for individual opportunities separately from account sharing .
you can use account , lead , case , and opportunity sharing to increase access to your data ; you can not restrict access beyond your organization ’s default access levels .
this type of sharing is called manual sharing , and is done by the sharing button on the record detail page .
can i transfer records to other users ?
in most editions , you can transfer ownership of records using one of these methods .
when you change a record ’s owner , salesforce also transfers ownership of certain related records .
transferring ownership of a single record you own click change owner on the record ’s detail page .
for more information , see changing ownership and transfer of associated items .
transferring ownership of multiple cases , leads , or custom object records that you own click the object ’s tab and view a list view .
select the records to be transferred , and click change owner .
transferring ownership of multiple records owned by other users use the mass transfer feature .
for more information about using mass transfer and which related records are transferred , see mass transferring records .
transferring record ownership using workflow rules
when a record owner is changed by a workflow rule , salesforce does not change the ownership of any related records .
how do i print salesforce records ?
to print the details of a salesforce record : 1 . click the printable view link located in the upper right corner of most detail pages .
a new browser window opens with the record displayed in a simple , print - ready format . 2 .
optionally , collapse and expand individual sections in the printable view by clicking the triangles next to the section headings . 105 learn salesforce basics monitor and analyze your data 3 .
optionally , click expand all or collapse all to show or hide all of the collapsible sections on the page .
related lists , such as the list of opportunities related to an account , are not collapsible .

note : on the console tab , you can click the print icon ( ) to open a record 's printable view .
monitor and analyze your data run a report to run a report , find it on the reports tab and click the report name .
most reports run automatically when you click the name .
if you ’re already viewing a report , click run report to run it immediately or schedule a future run .
in lightning experience , the run report button only appears after you save a report .

check your filter criteria to make sure some data is returned .
editions available in : both salesforce classic and lightning experience • due to field - level security , you do n’t have access to one of the groupings you selected .

try the following techniques to reduce the amount of data in your report : • filter for your own records , rather than all records .
• limit the scope of the data to a specific date range .
to run reports : • “ run reports ”
to schedule reports : • “ schedule reports ”
to create , edit , and delete reports : • “ create and customize reports ” and • exclude unnecessary columns from your report .

filter operators the operator in a filter is like the verb in a sentence .
when you choose filter criteria , use an operator to specify the action you want the filter to take .
you can use the following operators when entering filter criteria on list views , reports , dashboards , and some custom fields : operator uses equals use for an exact match .
for example , “
created equals today . ”
less than use for results that are less than the value you enter .
for example , “
quota less than 20k ” returns records where the quota field ranges from 0 to 19,999.99 .
greater than use when you want results that exceed the value you enter ; for example , “
quota greater than 20k ” returns records where the quota amount begins at 20,000.01 .
less or equal use for results that match or are less than the value you enter .
greater or equal use for results that match or exceed the value you enter . not equal to shows results that do n’t have the value you enter .

joined reports operator uses contains use for fields that include your search string , but sometimes also include other information .
for example , “ account contains california ” would find california travel , california pro shop , and surf california .

for example , “ account contains pro ” would find california pro shop and promotions corporation .
this operator is not case - sensitive .
does not contain eliminates records that do n’t contain the value you enter .
for example , “ mailing address line 2 does not contain p. o. box . ”

logic on comma - separated values .
on list views , reports , and dashboards , does not contain uses “ and ” logic .

account starts with california , ” you find california travel and california pro shop , but not surf california .
includes available when you choose a multi - select picklist as the selected field .
use this operator to find records that include one or more of the values you enter .
for example , if you enter “
interests includes hockey , football , baseball , ” you find records that have only hockey selected , and records that have two or three of the values entered .
results do not include partial matches of values .
excludes available when you choose a multi - select picklist as the selected field .

use to filter on ranges of values .
for each range , the filter returns results that are greater than or equal to the minimum value and less than the maximum value .

for example , if you enter “ warehouse location within 50 miles 37.775° –122.418° , ” , your list view includes all warehouses within a 50–mile radius of san francisco , california .
filter on blank values tips on filtering using blank values .
editions •
when you use the “ less than , ”
" greater than , ” “ less or equal , ” or “ greater or equal ” operators on fields that have numeric values , records with blank or “ null ”
values are returned as if their value is zero ( 0 ) .
for example , if you create a workflow rule or a lead assignment rule for accounts with the criteria annual revenue less than 100000 , account records match if their annual revenue is blank .
108 available in : both salesforce classic and lightning experience available in all editions learn salesforce basics
joined reports however , records with blank field values are not considered matches in report filters , custom list views , and account assignment rules ( which assign accounts to territories ) . •
to limit results to records that are blank or contain “ null ” values for a particular field , choose the field and the “ equals ” or “ not equal to ” operators , leaving the third field blank .
for example , amount equals returns records with blank amount fields .
you can search for blank values or other specified values at the same time .
for example , amount equals 1,,2 returns records where the amount is blank or contains the value “ 1 ” or “ 2 ” . filtering on special picklist values
when creating filter criteria , you can use special picklist values for your search criteria .
these are special picklists with values of either true or false .

how does search work ?
here 's an overview of the search process .
when you create or update a record ( 1 ) , the search engine breaks up the record ’s searchable text into smaller terms ( 2 ) .
then , it stores those smaller terms in the search index ( 3 ) .
note : after a searchable object ’s record is created or updated , it could take about 15 minutes or more for the updated text to become searchable .
an object ’s records are only searchable after they ’re stored in the search index .
when you enter a search term in the search field ( 1 ) , the search engine breaks up your search term into smaller terms ( 2 ) .
it matches those smaller terms to the record information stored in the index ( 3 ) , ranks the associated records by relevancy ( 4 ) , and returns the results you have access to ( 5 ) .

editions available in :
salesforce classic available in : all editions salesforce provides two types of lookups .
standard lookups all lookup fields use standard lookup search by default .
in standard lookup searches , salesforce queries a limited set of searchable fields for each object .
search results contain up to 50 records at a time .
standard objects are listed in ascending alphabetical order .
custom objects are listed in descending order by the date when you most recently accessed them .
you ca n’t sort , filter , or customize the columns in the search results .
119 learn salesforce basics search enhanced lookups if enabled by your administrator , salesforce uses enhanced lookup search for account , contact , opportunity , user , and custom object lookup fields .
enhanced lookups offer more search capabilities compared to standard lookups : • by default , enhanced lookups query a limited set of fields , known as name fields for each object .
if your search for a record returns a large number of matches , such as a contact with a widely used name , you can instead query all searchable fields for that record to narrow your results .
if available in the enhanced lookup search dialog , select all fields and enter other search terms unique to the record , such as the contact ’s email address . •
enhanced lookup search queries are broken into separate search terms at alphabetic , numeric , and special character boundaries .
for example , if you enter all4one in an enhanced lookup field , the resulting query searches for all and 4 and one .
consequently , entering all and 4 and one returns matches for all4one .
also , searching for s & returns fields containing both s & and & s. • you can sort and filter the results of enhanced lookup searches .
you can also hide and organize the columns that are displayed in the results window .
note : in addition to user - controlled filters , administrators can create lookup filters on fields that are in a lookup , master - detail , or hierarchical relationship to limit the valid values in lookup dialog results for the field .
• enhanced lookups return all records that match your search criteria and allow you to page through large sets of search results .
note : salesforce only returns matches for a custom object if your administrator has associated a custom tab with it .
you do n’t have to add the tab for display .
when you perform a blank lookup , a list of all recently used records displays .
search results vary for some object types : • for standard lookups of products and queues , the dialog shows an alphabetical listing of the first 50 records . •
for standard lookups of campaigns , the dialog shows the first 100 active campaigns . •
for the asset standard lookup on a case , the dialog shows all the assets tied to the contact on the case , if any . •
for standard or enhanced lookups of users , the dialog shows a list of recently accessed user records from across your organization .
tips for using standard and enhanced lookups consider these tips when using standard and enhanced lookups
. editions •
in standard lookup searches , a wildcard is automatically appended to each of your search terms .
for example , a search for bob jo is really a search for bob * jo * and returns items with bob jones , bobby jones , or bob johnson .
you can also explicitly use an asterisk ( * ) wildcard in your search string .
available in : salesforce classic available in : all editions •
for enhanced lookups in particular , the wildcard ca n't be the first character in the search term or phrase , and search results may include more records than you expect if your search terms contain a combination of letters , numbers , and special characters . •
if you enter a value in the lookup text box and save the record without clicking the lookup icon ( ) , salesforce automatically performs a standard lookup search .
if it finds an exact match , it saves that value to the lookup field , even if it finds other partial matches .
if it does n’t find an exact match and finds one or more partial matches , salesforce requires you to select a value from a drop - down list of matches .
if no results match the text you entered , an error displays instead .
• to search for contacts , leads , users , or other individuals that include spaces in the first name or last name fields , enter quotes around the terms .
for example , to search for someone with the last name von hausen , enter “ von hausen " . •
in organizations where the salesforce customer portal or partner portal is enabled , you can filter the results that appear on the user lookup dialog by selecting either a queue or group of users from the owner or assigned to drop - down list .
120 learn salesforce basics search •
if your organization uses divisions and you have the “
affected by divisions ”
permission , your lookup dialog search results include records in the division you select in the lookup dialog window .
lookup auto - completion if enabled by your administrator , lookups support auto - complete
. editions both standard lookups and enhanced lookups can display a dynamic list of matching recently used records when a lookup field is edited .
this list is restricted to objects of the appropriate type and , with the exception of lookups of users , is populated from recently used items .
for example , while editing an account lookup , you can see recently used accounts with names that match the prefix you have entered .
recently used contacts do n't appear in this list .
available in : salesforce classic available in : all editions lookup auto - completion is subject to the following restrictions : • you must have recently visited records of the appropriate type for the lookup 's auto - completion list to be populated .
• you must be editing the lookup field on a record 's edit page .
hover details are displayed only for lookup fields on object types that are included in lists of recently used records .
for example , products are n’t included in lists of recently used records , so hover details are n’t displayed for a lookup field on products .

editions available in : both salesforce classic and lightning experience available in all editions frequency prioritizes records that include more occurrences of the search terms .
in addition , records that contain all or more of multiple search terms entered are prioritized higher .
uniqueness prioritizes records that contain unique terms , under the assumption that uniqueness increases the likelihood of a relevant match .
location prioritizes records with the search term in the name , title , or subject type fields .
proximity prioritizes records with the search terms closer together with few or no intervening words .

167 learn salesforce basics limitations for search in salesforce classic when filtering search results , the operator is selected automatically based on the field type .
except as noted , all fields use the contains operator .
auto number and phone fields use the contains operator because they can contain non - numeric characters .
the = ( equals ) operator is used with these types of fields . •
dates • numbers , except auto number or phone fields • record ids explicitly using the or operator is only supported in number fields .
except for number fields , commas are used as or operators in search results filters .
for example , if you enter acme , california in the account name filter field , your results include account names with either acme or california .
for number fields ( where a comma can be part of a number ) commas are n't treated as or operators and you must explicitly enter the or operator .
if you specify more than one criterion , the result includes only records that match all the criteria .
for example , if you enter acme california in the account name filter field , your results include account names with both acme and california .
do n't include http:// or https:// in url filter criteria because you may not get the results that you expect .
when you enter values in url fields and save records , salesforce adds http:// to any url that does n't start with http:// or https://. the added http:// is n't stored in the database .
for example , if you enter salesforce.com in the website field and save the record , the website field displays http://salesforce , but the value stored is salesforce .
therefore , if you enter http://salesforce.com in the website filter field , your results do n't include your record .

learn salesforce basics get started with salesforce classic is my phone compatible with the salesforce classic mobile app ?
the salesforce classic mobile app can run on iphones , ipod touch devices , and most blackberry and android devices .
to find out if your phone can run the app , see the list of supported mobile devices .
note : supported features may vary depending on your mobile operating system and device model .
what salesforce data is stored on my device when i use the salesforce classic mobile app ?
using the salesforce classic mobile app to access salesforce on a mobile device is much different from using the full salesforce application on your computer .
mobile devices have a minimal amount of memory and a small screen , and do n’t always maintain a constant network connection .
to work with these limitations , a subset of your salesforce data is stored in a local database on your phone .
the following types of tabs are available in the salesforce classic mobile app : • all custom object tabs and these standard object tabs : – accounts –
assets – attachments – cases – contacts – content
– events –
groups – group members – leads – notes – opportunities – price books – products – solutions –
tasks –
users – dashboards –
reports • web and visualforce tabs note : the tabs and objects that you see in the app are determined by your mobile configuration and might not include all the tabs and objects listed here .
additionally , the iphone and android apps do n’t support reports .
when you open the tab for an object , you probably wo n't see all of your salesforce records .
for each mobilized object , your administrator can create filter criteria to limit the number of records on your device .
for example , in a large organization , sending all open and closed opportunities to your mobile device could consume too much memory or potentially crash it .
instead of sending all opportunities , your administrator might send a subset of them , such as open opportunities that you own that are scheduled to close this month .
198 learn salesforce basics get additional help can i see records in the salesforce classic mobile app that i ca n’t access in salesforce ?
no
. user permissions , sharing rules , and field - level security are inherited from salesforce — the mobile application enforces all the restrictions set up in salesforce .
how frequently does the salesforce classic mobile app update my data ?
the salesforce classic mobile app checks for data changes every 20 minutes .
during this incremental update , the server retrieves any newly created salesforce records that you own , and then sends that data to your device .
it also sends modifications to any records already stored on the device .
note : note the following about data synchronization : • the android and blackberry client apps adjust their data polling time based on app usage .
if the app is n’t in use , the polling time interval increases in an exponential fashion , until it reaches eight hours .
from that point forward , the device polls for data every eight hours .
this prevents the salesforce classic mobile app from draining the device battery when the app is rarely used .
• because only one app can run on the iphone at a time , the salesforce classic mobile app ca n’t request a data update unless the app is open .
when you launch the app on the iphone , it performs an incremental update unless a data synchronization has occurred in the past 20 minutes .
how do i use the salesforce classic mobile app to access records that are n't on my mobile device ?
the salesforce data available on your device is defined by your mobile configuration .
you can easily search for records that are n't automatically downloaded to your device .
a search box is available on each object tab in the salesforce classic mobile app , as well as on the app 's home page .
when i receive a call on my mobile device , will the salesforce classic mobile app open the associated contact record ?
the salesforce classic mobile app ca n’t open a salesforce contact when you receive incoming calls .
however , if you place a call from salesforce classic mobile , you ’re automatically prompted to log the call .
