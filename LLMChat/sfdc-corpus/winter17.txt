when you enable this beta , all of your url - based flows render using the lightning runtime instead of the classic runtime .
embed your flows in lightning pages ( beta ) we ’re rolling out a flow component for the lightning app builder .
you can now add flows to any lightning page — app pages , record pages , and home pages alike .
77 salesforce winter release notes lightning experience features in this release display flow screens in two columns ( beta ) when you build flows that collect lots of information , their screens can render as a never - ending skinny column of fields .
break up the layout of those screens by rendering specific flows in two columns .
security and identity authentication and identity : quicker logins , connected apps enhancements , more authentication options we ’ve introduced password - free logins with lightning login , u2f security keys and more options for two - factor authentication , and enhanced oauth features .
we redesigned the app launcher and connected app descriptions show up on app launcher tiles .
the app launcher for external identity customers takes on the new look too .
update existing connected app descriptions the revamped app launcher makes it easy for your users to discover your connected apps now that your app ’s name and description appear on an app launcher tile .
the description comes from the text that you supply in the description field when you create the app .
for the connected apps that you created before winter ' 17 , those descriptions appear in the app launcher as well .
so make sure that the names and descriptions of your existing apps are appropriate for a public audience and mistake - free .
you ’ve got 256 characters for a description .
make it work for you .
make the app launcher your landing page make it easy for your salesforce identity users to access what they need by presenting the redesigned app launcher as the default landing page when they log in to salesforce .
external identity app launcher has a new look if you set up salesforce identity for your customers or partners ( referred to as external identity ) , you probably used the aloha communities template with the app launcher .
when winter ' 17 releases , your app launcher takes on the fresh look of our redesigned app launcher . successfully reauthorize your users when provisioning connected apps for those customers using salesforce provisioning for connected apps , we ’ve improved how we handle users that you have reauthorized after unauthorizing them .
previously , reauthorizing a user would trigger a create event , which could cause an error since the user already existed .
salesforce now reactivates the existing user .
platform encryption : bring your own key , government cloud support , faster mass encryption bringing your own encryption key ( byok ) gives you even more control over your data security .

customizable campaign influence lets you set up multiple ways of tracking the influence that campaigns have on opportunities .
for each method you want to use , create a separate campaign influence attribution model .
to give credit to a campaign for the opportunities it helps generate , your marketing and sales users can manually associate the campaign with their opportunities .
alternatively , you or your partners can create triggers and workflows to add records automatically .
on campaign detail pages , your users can see the opportunities generated by a campaign , and the total revenue generated .
determine how to attribute revenue to campaigns out of the box , the salesforce influence model attributes 100% revenue credit to the primary campaign and 0% to any other campaigns users assign to an opportunity .
only the salesforce influence model supports auto - association .
auto - association adds campaigns to opportunities automatically when the contact on an opportunity is also a member of a campaign .
to attribute revenue more flexibly to campaigns , you or your partners can create custom influence attribution models .
for example , create a model that evenly distributes credit for an opportunity across all campaigns that touched it .
or create a model that gives 100% credit to the first or last campaign that touched an opportunity .
with customizable campaign influence , you can create a model for virtually any scenario that suits your business .
if you ’d like to prevent your sales or marketing users from adding or editing campaign influence records , you can lock any of your attribution models .
records for locked models can only be updated via the api .
see which campaigns influenced an opportunity campaign influence records show which campaigns have influenced a specific opportunity .

to let your users add and edit campaign influence records from their opportunity detail pages , keep the primary model unlocked .
your other attribution models can accrue campaign influence records , but only via triggers , workflows , and the api .
depending on your business needs , you can add custom fields to your campaign influence records .

do more with lightning experience note :  editing inline is different from doing a “ mass action .
”
both are done from list views , and both are efficient .
but with inline editing , you ’re saving a change to fields on one or more records .
a mass action is selecting records and then clicking a button to do something with those records — for example , add them to a campaign .

the list view uses filter logic that contains or clauses . •

name fields in rows visible in custom report types name values for rows that are n’t accessible based on sharing rules are now visible in custom report types .
these rows are hidden only if the name values of the lookup rows do n’t match the filter criteria .

editions available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions consider a custom report based on cases with a lookup relationship to contacts .
all contact names are visible , but other contact fields display null values based on your org ’s sharing rules .

a ” are now returned in the report result .

considerations for activating the company info for accounts rule recommendation to use appexchange package instead of assessment option user permissions
to clean accounts manually •
“ read ” and “ create ” on the d&b company object the company info for accounts clean rule includes options to update your data or generate a read - only assessment .
conflicts with existing clean setup the company info for accounts clean rule conflicts with clean jobs .
to prevent conflicts and confusion , do the following .
• deactivate clean jobs on your accounts . •
on account page layouts , remove the elements related to clean jobs : the clean button and the clean status field .
access for users
who clean records manually to let your users clean accounts manually , do the following : • make sure that users have “ read ” and “ create ” access to the d&b company object .
when a user cleans an account , the rule creates an associated d&b company record ( if the record does n’t exist ) . • adjust field - level security to give users access to all the account fields containing data provided by the rule .
triggers , workflows , and push notifications before activating a company info rule , review your settings for triggers , workflows , and push notifications .
using a company info rule can set off those mechanisms .
no support for field mapping customization you ca n’t customize field mapping for company info rules .
nor does customized field mapping for clean jobs carry over to company info rules .
fields containing data provided by the company info for accounts rule account name account site employees fax sic code sic description 133 salesforce winter release notes analytics : lightning enhancements , trending in wave , wave dashboard designer , and more annual revenue billing address industry naics code company d - u - n - s number naics description d&b company description ownership phone ticker symbol tradestyle year
started website activate the company info for accounts rule 1 .
from setup , enter clean rules  in the quick find box , then select clean rules . 2 . edit the company info for accounts clean rule .
company info rules include an option to clean all records when the rule is activated or saved .
if you choose that option , then salesforce immediately checks whether new data is available for your existing accounts .
for new accounts , salesforce checks whether new data is available when the accounts are saved .
new data is added only to blank fields — your data is never overwritten .
guidelines for cleaning records manually when the company info for accounts rule is activated because the rule does n’t overwrite data , when users update the company d - u - n - s number field value while cleaning manually , they must delete the d&b company field value .
then , when company information is added , clean adds updated values for those two fields and links the correct d&b company record to the account .

if trending is stopped and then restarted , a new snapshot dataset is created , with a new trending dashboard .
the previously trended dataset is not included in the new dashboard . •
to ensure good performance , certain limits are placed on the size of the snapshots and the number of trended datasets each user can create : – maximum number of trended datasets per user : 5 –
maximum number of rows per snapshot : 100,000 –
maximum monthly number of rows for all snapshots per org : 40 million – trended datasets count towards the overall wave platform limits , including total number of rows – trending dashboards ca n't be created from joined reports accelerate analytics with prebuilt wave apps we ’ve expanded our prebuilt apps offering with service wave and event monitoring wave , and an update to sales wave .

quickly create dashboards with templates and widget wizards take advantage of the new dashboard templates for the wave dashboard designer .
these templates are created with best dashboard practices in mind .
each template offers a unique dashboard layout with empty widgets .
click inside each widget to kick off a wizard that helps you populate the widget with data .
the simple wizards save you time and automatically build the right steps for you .
note :  except for the “ blank dashboard in the classic designer ” template , the classic designer templates are no longer available .
existing dashboards built from these templates will continue to work .
the templates make use of the new widget wizards .
previously , when creating a widget , you had to add the widget to the dashboard , build the step , and then apply the step to the widget .
to simplify the process for creating chart , table , and filter widgets , the new widget wizards do all these tasks in one fell swoop .
for example , when creating a date widget , the wizard makes you select the date field in a dataset used to filter the results .
to see how easy it is , let ’s create a dashboard .
in this example , you create a dashboard that compares the product performance of two different systems . 1 .
in wave , select create > dashboard .
155 salesforce winter release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level 2 .
in the list of templates , select comparison dashboard and click continue .

by understanding wave ’s logic , you can set the properties appropriately .
wave uses the following logic when determining which layout to use for a device . 1 .
a layout is eligible for use when the device accessing the dashboard meets all device properties set in the layout panel . 2 . 3 .
if more than one layout is eligible , the one with the most device properties set is used .
if there 's a tie , the last defined layout is used .
if no layouts are eligible with the device , the first defined layout is used .
do more with the new bindings syntax with the new bindings syntax for wave dashboard designer , you can apply conditional formatting to highlight content or dynamically change widget properties based on selections or results .
for example , color code the values of number widgets based on thresholds to draw attention to low and high numbers .
or , add a toggle widget that dynamically sets the chart type to show either a map or a bar chart . let ’s say you want to change the colors of measures in three number widgets based on whether the numbers are high ( green ) , medium ( yellow ) or low ( red ) .
163 salesforce winter release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level in the dashboard json , compute the color based on the measure of each step .
then apply the computed color to the numbercolor field of each number widget .

build static steps with ease use the widget wizard , not json , to build static steps .
the wizard walks you through the process of adding custom values for the step .
for example , you can create a toggle widget that filters case records in a chart based on the following options : high priority cases , medium priority cases , and low priority cases . 1 .
in the step panel of the wave dashboard designer , click create step .
if you do n’t see the step panel , click the dashboard header to show it .
2 . click create a static step with custom values .
167 salesforce winter release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level 3 .
add the list of values , including the display name and value for each .
note :  the display name appears in the associated widget .
values are optional , but if included , you can bind them to other steps to filter the results of other widgets in the dashboard . 4 .
to create the static step , click create .
wave adds the static step to the steps panel , making it available for use by other widgets in the dashboard .
5 .
to apply this static step to a widget , drag the step to an empty space in the canvas .
by default , a toggle widget is added to the dashboard , showing the custom values as toggle options .
if needed , you can change the chart type in the widget properties .
6 .
to enable a selection in the toggle widget to filter another widget , bind the custom values of the static step to the step of the other widget .
for example , going back to the cases example , when you select high priority cases in the toggle widget , only those cases should appear in the chart .
to enable this interactivity , bind the toggle widget step to chart widget step .
in the binding , you specify the logic used to determine the case priority for each case .
for more information about binding static steps , see the wave analytics bindings developer guide .

to gain better precision when placing widgets in a dashboard , increase the number of columns in the designer grid using the layout properties .
previously , the grid always contained 12 columns . •
in previous releases , the entire dashboard would not render when there was a problem with a step .
now , the widget with the problem step displays an error icon , but the remaining widgets render correctly . 169 salesforce winter release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level gain more control of the dashboard using the new properties wave dashboards contain new properties for configuring new features and for enabling finer control of charts .
to increase usabilty , some properties have new labels and locations .

chart types wave designer dashboards support the following new chart types : flatgauge , pyramid , polargauge , rating , and stackpyramid .
chart properties wave designer dashboards contain numerous new chart properties that allow you to configure how they appear in a dashboard .
for a list and the descriptions of all json properties for each chart , see visualizing data with charts .
wave dashboard designer no longer uses the totals  chart property for compare and values tables .
as a workaround , you can compute the totals in a calculated field in a compare table .
grid layouts you now configure dashboard properties , like cell spacing in the grid and the dashboard background , under the new style  key instead of the gridlayoutstyle  key .
step types wave designer dashboards support the following new step types .
• aggregateflex .
it ’s like the aggregate  step type .
to leverage the new bindings syntax , use this new step type .
aggregate  supports the old bindings syntax . •
staticflex
it ’s like the static  step type .
wave designer dashboards still support aggregate , grain , and static .
although , salesforce recommends that you use the new aggregateflex  and staticflex  step types instead of aggregate  and static .
when you create steps , wave applies the new step types .
the multi  step type is deprecated for wave designer dashboards only and automatically converted to aggregate .
note :  wave ca n’t convert a multi  step for a compare table that contains a separate saql query for each column .
to fix this step , re - create the compare table .
understand the changes coming to bindings
in winter ' 17 , the wave dashboard designer uses a new bindings syntax for steps .
if you convert a dashboard created in the classic designer to wave dashboard designer , wave converts the bindings to the new syntax .
in rare cases , this change can cause problems with some dashboards .
if wave ca n’t convert the binding , the step is broken .
for each broken step , wave shows an error icon on the affected widget in the dashboard .
hover over the icon to view the error .
to fix the error , re - create the step using the new bindings syntax .
for more information about the new binding syntax and examples of bindings , see the wave analytics bindings developer guide .
171 salesforce winter release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level note :  the new bindings syntax does n’t affect existing dashboards created in wave dashboard designer .

replication has been a pilot feature since the winter ‘
16 release , but now , in winter ‘ 17 , it ’s generally available .
multiple dataflows , which were added to the replication pilot in the spring ‘ 16 release , are now also generally available when you enable replication .
what ’s more , you can now view and edit your replication settings , and create dataflows , all in the new data manager .
how does replication work ?
when you enable replication , wave looks at the sfdcdigest nodes in your existing scheduled user dataflows to see which salesforce objects and fields you ’re currently extracting .
using this information , wave sets up replication for each object , to extract the data separately .
you can schedule this replication to run ahead of your dataflows .
if you later update your dataflows , or create new ones , wave automatically updates the replication with relevant changes .
enabling replication and configuring replication settings you can enable replication from setup .
enter wave analytics in the quick find box , then click settings .
select enable replication , and then click save .
important :  a lot goes on when you enable replication , some of which might require your attention .
for this reason , we recommend that you read understand what happens when you enable replication before you flip the switch .
when that ’s done , the data manager is your new home for all things replication .
here you can view the enabled salesforce objects , set up a replication schedule , and run replication .
181 salesforce winter release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level to configure the replication settings for an object , click the object in the list .
here you can remove fields from the replication , and add a filter to replicate specific data .
incremental extracts
by default , replication extracts data from each salesforce object incrementally .
records are inserted , updated , or deleted to match changes in the object since the previous replication run .
because only changes are extracted , replication runs faster .
whenever you make field changes in an sfdcdigest dataflow node , such as adding or removing fields or changing field attributes , wave triggers a full extract of data from the object the next time replication is run .
to turn off incremental extracts for a replicated object , add the incremental  parameter to the object ’s sfdcdigest node in your user dataflow , and set its value to false .
for example : { " extract_opportunities " : { " action " : " sfdcdigest " , " parameters " : { " object " : " opportunity " , " incremental " : false , " fields " : [ { " name " : " i d " } , 182 salesforce winter release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level { " name " : " name " } , { " name " : " stagename " } , { " name " : " closedate " } , { " name " : " accountid " } , { " name " : " ownerid " } ] } } note :  incremental extracts are not supported for all salesforce objects .
for this reason , replication automatically performs a full extract of any unsupported object .
in addition , formula fields can become out of sync with your replicated object in incremental mode .
therefore , we recommend that you turn off incremental extracts for objects containing formula fields .
create multiple dataflows with replication enabled with the wave analytics platform license , and replication enabled , you can now build multiple dataflows for different purposes and run them on their own schedules .
this lets you break up a large default dataflow into smaller , independent ones to build datasets faster .
you can delete any dataflows that you create , or unschedule them to temporarily prevent them from running .
you ca n’t delete the default dataflow .
you can create and manage dataflows in dataflow view , either in the data monitor or the monitor area of the new data manager .
note :  with the wave analytics platform license , your org can have up to 10 dataflows .
this includes the default dataflow , and wave app dataflows such as sales wave and service wave .
keep in mind that each dataflow run counts towards your limit of 24 dataflow runs per day .
create datasets with data prep ( beta ) data prep is the quick new way to cook up new datasets using your existing datasets as ingredients .
combine data from multiple datasets , remove fields , and transform field values using a clear user interface , right within the new data manager .
and not one line of json !
note :  this release contains a beta version of data prep that is production quality but has known limitations .
contact salesforce if you ’d like to try it out ! 183 salesforce winter release notes wave analytics :
take data analysis to the next level i ’m hungry for more .
how does data prep work ?
in data prep , you create a dataset by first creating a recipe for it .
just like a food recipe , a dataset recipe contains a list of ingredients ( your existing datasets ) , and a set of instructions ( the transformations you want to perform on these datasets ) .
when your recipe is ready , you can use it to create a target dataset right away or schedule it to update the dataset on a recurring basis .
wave saves your recipes , so you can update them or even use them to create new recipes .
create a dataset with a recipe when you create datasets in data prep , you start off with the existing dataset you want to work from .
open up the data manager and head over to the datasets tab .
here you see a list of the datasets available to you .
click the dataset you want to start with and enter a recipe name .
choose carefully as this name is also used for the target dataset you are creating .
next , you see the dataset recipe page . 1 .
a preview of the data you ’ll see in your target dataset . 2 .
view and manage your transformations here , or navigate the fields in your preview .
3 . want to add data from another dataset ?
click here .
4 .
ca n’t find the field you ’re looking for ?
click here to view fields as a list , search for fields , or hide fields in the preview .
184 salesforce winter release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level 5 .
if you ’ve added data or transformed fields , click here to see a list of these transformations .
need to remove transformations ?
you can do that from here , too .
6 .
do your field values need work ?
click here to change case , split a field value ( such as phone number into area code and number ) , or find and replace values .
when you ’re done , you can save the recipe and come back to it later or click create dataset to go ahead and run the recipe .
note :  if you ’ve enabled replication , you can also create recipes from your replicated objects !
manage your dataset recipes from the recipes tab , you can track the status of all your recipes and their respective target datasets , and delete recipes .
icon status recipe saved recipe pushed target dataset
not created target dataset created explanation new or updated recipe that has been saved , but not selected to run .

remove fields from your datasets with the slicedataset transformation use the new slicedataset transformation to select a subset of fields from a dataset in your dataflow for use in a new dataset or in other transformations .
this feature allows you to create multiple datasets , each with different sets of fields from the same salesforce object , without performing a separate extract for each dataset .
this helps you out if you are using replication , which performs only one extract of data from each salesforce object . 185 " removefieldsfromextractopportunities " : { " action " : " slicedataset " , " parameters " : { " source " : " extractopportunities " , " mode " : " drop " , " fields " : [ " name " : " i d " " name " : " productid " { } , { } ] } } salesforce winter release notes wave analytics : take data analysis to the next level here ’s an example .
let ’s say your dataflow contains the sfdcdigest node , extractopportunities , which extracts all fields from the opportunity object .
but some of your users do n’t want i d fields in their opportunities dataset .
no problem .
just add a slicedataset node to your dataflow , specifying the source node and the fields you want to remove .
{ } the clever part of the transformation is the mode parameter , which lets you choose between two modes : drop  or select .
" mode " : " drop " " mode " : " select " set mode to drop  to remove the fields you specify —
great if you only want to remove a few fields .
set it to select  to keep the fields you specify .
think how much time select  mode is going to save you when you want to remove a couple of hundred fields !
there are just a couple of things to bear in mind to avoid those pesky error messages .
the mode  parameter is required , so do n’t leave it out , and you must specify at least one field .

take advantage of new string and aggregation saql functionality wave ’s saql functionality continues to expand with exciting new functionality in string handling and aggregation .
string functions we added a number of key string handling functions . • starts_with
— returns true  if the string starts with the specified prefix . •
ends_with — returns true  if the string ends with the specified suffix .
186 salesforce winter release notes service : big changes to cti , more features for field service • index_of — returns the index of the specified occurrence of the search string , beginning at the specified position .
the default position is 1 , which means that the function begins searching at the first character .
if present , an integer indicates which occurrence to search for .
for example , if 2 is specified and there is more than one matching occurrence , the index of the second occurrence is returned . •
replace — returns the string with every occurrence of the search string replaced by the supplied replacement string .
aggregation functions important new aggregation functions have been added , too . •
regr_slope — this simple linear regression function accepts a grouped dependent numeric expression and a grouped independent numeric expression .
it returns the slope of the regression line . •
regr_intercept — this simple linear regression function accepts a grouped dependent numeric expression and a grouped independent numeric expression .
it returns the y - intercept for the regression line . •
regr_r2 — this simple linear regression function accepts a grouped dependent numeric expression and a grouped independent numeric expression .
it returns the coefficient of determination ( also called r - squared or goodness of fit ) for the regression .
for more information , see the wave analytics saql reference .
review updates to the rest api for wave the rest api for wave has new endpoints and representations . trending report snapshots in wave is now supported through the /wave / trendedreports/${trendedreportid } and /wave / trendedreports endpoints .
replicated datasets are supported through the /wave / replicateddatasets/${id } , /wave / replicateddatasets , and /wave / replicateddatasets/${id}/fields endpoints , but require the orghasreplicationenabled , elteditor , and insightsadmin permissions .
many representations have new properties to support new or changed features , particularly for dashboards .

open cti is now available in lightning experience as well as salesforce classic .
previously , open cti worked only in salesforce classic .
so how does open cti work in lightning experience ?
the path to lightning experience gave us an opportunity to modernize the open cti api .
we created a new open cti api just for lightning experience that ’s easier to use .
the api uses json objects as parameters instead of individual parameters , returns error messages that are easier to understand , and adapts to the lightning platform .
now there are two separate open cti apis —
one for salesforce classic and one for lightning experience .
previous versions of open cti are now part of the open cti api for salesforce classic .
the two apis provide similar methods , but a few methods behave differently .
note :  open cti for lightning experience works only in lightning apps — it does n’t work in classic apps .
even though you can view classic apps in lightning experience , those apps are still classic apps under the covers .
to check if your app is a lightning app , use the app manager in setup .
how do i start making calls in lightning experience ?
to get up and running , complete these high - level steps . 1 .
work with your cti vendor to create an open cti implementation that works for lightning experience . 2 .
install an open cti for lightning package .
the call center definition file in your package now identifies the user interface you plan to use — salesforce classic , lightning experience , or both .
simply specifying both user interfaces in a call center definition file does n’t mean that your softphone works in both uis .
3 .
create a lightning app and add the open cti softphone option .
tip :
to help you get started , we ’ve created an open cti demo adapter for lightning experience .
go check it out !
if you want your open cti implementation to work in lightning experience and in a salesforce console , your cti vendor must create a unique implementation that uses both salesforce classic and lightning experience .
the console might look and feel like lightning experience , but it ’s actually only available in salesforce classic .
for information about creating your open cti implementation , including differences in open cti api functionality , see the open cti developer guide .
what does a softphone look like in lightning experience ?
after your open cti implementation is all set up , your softphone displays in the utility bar located in the footer of lightning experience .

after you create a resource , you can add details about their availability and expertise . •
in the service territories related list , add territories where the resource is available to work .
editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions with the service cloud indicate whether each territory is the resource ’s primary , secondary , or relocation territory .
the primary territory is typically the territory where the person works most often — for instance , near their home base — while secondary territories are territories where they can be assigned to appointments if needed .
relocation territories represent temporary moves .
service resources can have multiple secondary territories , but only one primary territory . •
in the skills related list , assign skills to show the resource ’s areas of expertise .
use the start time  and end time  fields to specify when the resource ’s skill is valid .
for instance , if the skill represents a year - long certification , the end time  would be the date the certification expires . •
in the service appointments related list , view the service appointments assigned to the resource . •
in the absences related list , create absences to represent time periods when the resource is unavailable to work . •
if the resource is a contractor , define their daily , weekly , or monthly capacity in the capacities related list .

with a customizable status field and the ability to track differences between scheduled and actual appointment times , service appointments make it easy to keep your customers happy .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
service appointments are always associated with a parent record , which can be a work order , work order line item , opportunity , account , or asset .
the type of parent record tells you about the nature of the service appointment .
• service appointments on work orders and work order line items offer a more detailed view of the editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions with the service cloud work being performed .
work orders and work order line items contain general information about the task , while service appointments include the details about scheduling and ownership .
• service appointments on assets represent work being performed on the asset that is n’t associated with a work order .
• service appointments on accounts represent work being performed for the account that is n’t associated with a work order . • service appointments on opportunities represent work being performed for the opportunity that is n’t associated with a work order .
create service appointments from the service appointments tab in salesforce , or from the service appointments related list on supported records .
on service appointments , you can track : • subject and description • length of the appointment •
arrival window 193 salesforce winter release notes field service : meet your field service lightning toolbox • discrepancies between scheduled and actual appointment times •
due date , which typically reflects terms in a customer ’s service - level agreement • appointment status you can also expose service appointments in communities so customers can view and create their own appointments .
for details , see expand your community to include field service data .
when you create a service appointment , assign it to one or more service resources using the assigned resources related list .
to get started , see create service appointments ( can be outdated or unavailable during release preview ) .
example :  suppose you create a work order to track a customer ’s annual refrigerator maintenance .
in the service appointments related list on the work order , you create an annual maintenance appointment .
during the appointment , the technician completes most of the maintenance but determines that a replacement part must be ordered and installed .
the technician changes the appointment status to can not complete , and a second service appointment is created on the work order to track the installation .
when the second appointment is completed and it is determined that the fridge is fully repaired , the second appointment and the work order can then be closed .
easy as pie !
define your field service footprint with service territories create service territories to represent the regions where your team works .
you can set each territory ’s operating hours , assign service resources to a territory , and create territory hierarchies .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
if you want to use service territories in salesforce , determine which territories you need to create .
depending on how your business works , you may decide to create territories based on cities , counties , or other factors .
if you plan to build out a hierarchy of service territories , create the highest - level territories first .
editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions with the service cloud create service territories from the service territories tab .
after you create a territory , you can add members to it via the service territory members related list .
service territory members are service resources who work within the territory .
associating them with a territory ensures that they ’re assigned to appointments near their home base .
to get started , see set up service territories ( can be outdated or unavailable during release preview ) .
example :  you can create a hierarchy of territories to represent the areas where your team works in california .

changes to work order enablement in winter , we ’ve made some changes to the way work orders are enabled .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
work orders are one of the standard field service lightning features , but they ’re the only feature that ’s available by default in all supported edition orgs — whether or not field service lightning is enabled .
to access other field service lightning features and to get the winter enhancements to work orders , enable field service lightning .
( you need a field service lightning permission set license to enable it . ) 1 .
from setup , enter field service settings  in the quick find box , then click field service settings . 2 .
select enable field service lightning .
if you do n’t have a field service lightning permission set license , you just see an enable work orders option , which is on by default .
3 . click save .
note : • the field service settings page replaces the work order settings page in setup . •
if you have a professional edition org with the service cloud , work orders are the only field service lightning feature available to you .
work orders are enabled by default , but you can disable them on the field service settings page . create
criteria - based sharing rules for work orders ( beta ) you can define up to 50 criteria - based sharing rules to control who can view and update work orders .

enable this feature from setup in lightning experience only .
users are notified when any of the following actions occurs on a work order or work order line item that they own or follow . •
a text or file post is added • a tracked field is updated •
the record owner changes •
the resource assignments change on a related service appointment note :  if the option to track all related objects is selected in your feed tracking settings for work orders , users are also notified when child records of work orders — such as service appointments — are created or deleted .
to turn on work order notifications , enable the notification option on the field service settings page in setup .
202 salesforce winter release notes field service : meet your field service lightning toolbox updated limits on work order hierarchies work order hierarchies can now have up to 10,000 records , and there are no longer any limits on hierarchy depth and width .
previously , a work order could have up to 2,000 child work orders , and a hierarchy of work orders could have up to 50 levels .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
similarly , work order line item hierarchies can now have up to 10,000 records .
new status options on work orders work orders and their line items have three new status values , and we removed the scheduled  and assigned  values from the work order status options .
in addition , new status - related fields make it easier to keep tabs on work being performed for customers .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
the status  picklist field on both work orders and work order line items now contains the following values : • new — record was created , but there hasn’t yet been any activity . •
in progress — work has begun . •
on hold —
work is paused . •
completed —
work is complete .
• can not complete — work could not be completed . •
closed —
all work and associated activity is complete . •
canceled — work is canceled , typically before any work began .
changing a work order ’s status does n’t affect its line items’ statuses , and vice versa .
if work orders were enabled in your org before winter , you ’ll continue to see the previous status  values on work orders and work order line items until you modify the field or its values .
a new is closed checkbox on work order line items also indicate whether a line item is closed .
changing the line item ’s status to closed  causes this checkbox to be selected .
this makes it easy to report on closed versus open line items .
finally , work orders and work order line items have a new picklist field , status category , which contains the same seven values as the status field as well as a none  value .
now when you create a custom value for the status  field , you 're prompted to select the status category that it belongs to .
for example , if you create a waiting for response  value , you may decide that it belongs in the on hold  category .
the status category  field can be useful to reference in custom apps , triggers , and validation rules .
status categories let you extend and customize the work life cycle while still maintaining a consistent work classification for tracking , reporting , and business process management .
if you ’d like to use the field , add it to your work order and work order line item page layouts .
important :  in orgs created during or after winter , the default status values on both work orders and work order line items are automatically assigned to their corresponding status category .
for example , the new  status has a status category of new .
however , if work orders were enabled in your org before winter , existing status values have a status category of none  which ca n’t be updated .
if you want to change the status category from none  for an existing status value , a little housekeeping in setup is necessary .
these steps apply to status values on both work orders and work order line items .
step step 1 .
for each status value , create a new “ dummy ” status value with a modified name and an appropriate status category .
example if you have a status value of completed , create an additional status value with these settings : • name : completed_1 • status category : completed 203 salesforce winter release notes field service : meet your field service lightning toolbox step example note :  your default setup may have hidden status categories .
you also need to create new status values for those status categories .
step 2 .
edit the status category of the original status value that your dummy value was based on .
step 3 .
to keep things tidy , delete the dummy value .
edit the completed  status value so its status category is completed .
delete the completed_1  value that you created .
streamlined work order pricing we ’ve made some changes to the way work order line items and price books work together .
if you ’re using the pricing features on work orders , you ’ll know that you can associate a price book with each work order , and price book entries ( products ) to each of the work order ’s line items .
for example , you can associate your “ standard price book ” with a particular work order , and create three line items on the work order which correspond to product a , product b , and product c as listed in the price book .
previously , it was possible for the pricebookentryid  and product2id  fields on a work order line item to get out of sync .
this could happen if a user selected a pricebook entry , then selected a product that did n’t correspond with that pricebook entry .
in winter ( api version 38.0 ) , filling out the pricebookentryid field automatically populates the corresponding product2id field , which is read - only to preserve the integrity of your data .
we also made the following changes to price - related fields on work order line items : • the pricebookentryid  field is now editable , and its label in the user interface changed from pricebook entry  to product  for clarity . •
the product2id  field is now read - only , and ca n’t be added to page layouts or updated via the api . •
when you select a product on a work order line item , the product must be included in the parent work order ’s price book .
if the work order does n’t list a price book , you can not add products to its line items .
if you were n’t using the pricing fields , including product , on work orders before winter , these changes do n’t affect you .
if you were using the pricing fields on work orders before winter , we recommend taking the following steps : • update to api version 38.0 to keep your data in sync . •
if you ’ve written custom code or apps that reference the product2id field on work order line items , update your code to reference the pricebookentryid  field instead . •
if you need the product2id  field on work order line items to be editable , consider creating a custom visualforce page based on api version 37.0 .
• check your work order line item page layouts to make sure they contain the product  field ( whose api name is pricebookentryid ) so you can continue associating work order line items with products .
this table explains how existing work order line items are affected when you upgrade to api version 38.0 ( winter ) .
in some cases the product  field must be updated manually .

to make room for an added agent alert to chat time - outs , we ’ve increased the chat time - out default settings .
this feature is available in salesforce classic only .
editions available in : salesforce classic we added an agent alert to chat timeouts so your agents know when a chat is timing out soon from a customer ’s slow ( or nonexistent ) response , or from the customer losing their connection .
this alert prevents abrupt endings for your agents’ chats , and gives your agents another shot at sending the customer a gentle reminder to find their way back to the chat window .
if you ’re currently using time - outs , you now have our default values of 40 seconds until the warning appears for the agent , and 110 seconds until the chat ends .
previously , the default setting was 40 seconds until the chat ends .
these new default values may sound low , but keep in mind that the timeout does n’t start right away — there can be a difference of up to 40 seconds .
if these numbers do n’t work for your team , mosey on over to your deployment settings and change them to something that suits you better .
time - outs apply to all chats , whether they ’re routed through live agent or omni - channel .

note :  this feature is available for communities using the winter ’16 and later versions of the customer service ( napili ) template .
example :  let ’s say you specialize in building partner relationship management ( prm ) communities for the manufacturing or tech industries .
with lightning bolt , you can build and export a prm - focused bolt solution that ’s easy to distribute to your customers .
after the template is installed on a customer ’s org , you can further customize it to suit their unique needs .
by building the bulk of the solution in your org and then distributing it to your customers’ orgs , you can launch their communities in no time .
example :  let ’s say you ’re an isv who builds several custom lightning components and a custom page to create an e - commerce feature for use in community builder .
now you can quickly bundle the page and its components into a single package and distribute it to your customers .
what is a bolt solution ?
at its simplest , a lightning bolt solution comprises a template that ’s made up of a theme layout and css , along with pages , content layouts , and lightning components .
bolt solutions seamlessly integrate with salesforce , and incorporate business logic , custom objects , industry best practices , and more .
use the customer service ( napili ) template as a base to build your custom template with standard pages and components , or create custom pages , layouts , and components of your own .
when you ’re ready to export the template , head on over to the new developer section in the settings area .
add a name and category for the template , along with at least one thumbnail image and some of the key template features .
this information appears in the community creation wizard and helps users understand the purpose and benefits of your template . 244 salesforce winter release notes community builder :
where everything is flexible , customizable , and reusable after you export a template , it appears in the community creation wizard in your org , where you can use it as a base for building new communities .
similarly , you can export a single page , which includes the page ’s content layout and components .
after you export a page , it appears in the new page dialog box in all the communities in your org .
note :  as part of the toolbar redesign in community builder , we moved the developer console button to the developer section . 245 salesforce winter release notes community builder : where
everything is flexible , customizable , and reusable what about packaging and distribution ?
in addition to using exported templates and pages in your own org , you can also package the solutions for distribution to your customers’ orgs .
we recommend using managed packages to avoid naming conflicts with other packages in your customer 's org or your own .
in packages under setup , select lightning community template or lightning page as the component type .
then upload the package and share the link privately with your clients , customers , or partners .
after a template is installed in another org , it appears in the org ’s community creation wizard .
installed pages appear in the new page dialog box .
to manage imported and exported templates , go to lightning community templates in setup .
to manage imported and exported pages , go to lightning community pages .

really quickly with custom theme layouts create custom theme layouts to instantly update the look and feel of your entire community .
customize the header and footer to match your company ’s style , and create a custom search bar and user profile menu .
then easily switch between your custom theme layouts , search , and user profile menus , or package them up to share with other orgs .
whether you ’re a consulting partner or an isv , or you simply want to revamp your own community , custom theme layouts make rebranding a cinch .
note :  this feature is available for communities using the winter ’16 and later versions of the customer service ( napili ) template .
what ’s a theme layout ?
a theme layout is the top - level layout for the template pages ( 1 ) in your community .
it includes the common header and footer ( 2 ) , and often includes navigation , search , and the user profile menu .
the theme layout applies to all the pages in your community , except the login pages .
in contrast , the renamed content layout ( 3 ) defines the content regions of your pages , such as a two - column layout . 246 salesforce winter release notes community builder : where everything is flexible , customizable , and reusable how do theme layouts work ?
previously , you could n’t modify the template header region of a customer service ( napili ) template , apart from editing the properties of the components within it .
now developers can create a custom theme layout component in the developer console that implements the forcecommunity : themelayout  interface .
when the component is ready , you simply select the new theme layout ( 1 ) in settings > theme .
and presto - chango , all the pages in your community are transformed !
and if your developer creates a custom search component ( using the new forcecommunity : searchinterface ) or a custom user profile component ( using the new forcecommunity : profilemenuinterface ) , you can swap them out too .
select use a custom search component or use a custom user profile component ( 2 ) and choose the custom component you want .
247 salesforce winter release notes example : community builder :
where everything is flexible , customizable , and reusable because a theme layout is a lightning component , you can package it in the same way as standard salesforce components , using the same tools .
select lightning component bundle as the package component type , add the theme layout component and any custom search or user profile components , and you ’re good to go .
note :  as part of our updates to the theme area , we renamed the show loading indicator as the page loads option to show stencils when loading page content to better reflect its purpose .
these settings apply only to the customer service ( napili ) template .

in the community builder menu ( 1 ) , we removed the link to site.com studio because you no longer need it to configure your community , unless you ’re creating a multilingual community .
if you want to add languages to your community , fret not —
the link to site.com studio is still available in settings > languages . •
the page menu ( 2 ) , and the undo and redo ( 3 ) , view mode ( 4 ) , preview ( 5 ) , and publish ( 6 ) buttons are now located on the slim toolbar across the top of the page . •
in the page editor , click in the page menu ( 7 ) to open the page properties editor . 248 salesforce winter release notes community builder : where everything is flexible , customizable , and reusable •
the context - sensitive property editor ( 8) appears only when you select a component to edit .
you can also reposition the property editor wherever you like ! •
we removed the user profile profile menu to save space and focus on community builder activities .

then check out the new developer area .

when you add a component , it appears in the lightning components pane of all the template - based communities in your org . 249 salesforce winter release notes community builder :

your community ’s analytics data streams directly to the google analytics service where you can review and interpret it . 250 salesforce winter release notes community builder :
where everything is flexible , customizable , and reusable for developers of custom lightning components for communities , we provide the new global forcecommunity : analyticsinteraction event .
use this event to track events triggered by the custom component .
for example , you could create a custom button and include the forcecommunity : analyticsinteraction event in the button ’s controller .
whenever a user clicks the button , event data is sent to google analytics .
control public access for each page in your community set page - specific access to your community pages .
then you can restrict or open up access as you see fit .

if you allow public access , your community pages are accessible to the public , including unlicensed users .
if you do n’t allow public access , members must log in to access the community .

this setting makes the page public , regardless of the community ’s default setting .
requires login —
this setting makes the page private and requires members to log in , regardless of the community ’s default setting .
251 salesforce winter release notes community builder :
where everything is flexible , customizable , and reusable you ’re probably thinking , “
wait a second .
how does this work with the profile - based page visibility introduced in summer ‘ 16 ? ”
here ’s how .
when a member is trying to access a page , we first check the community ’s default setting .
is it public or does it require users to log in ?
after that first check , we look at the page access .
we finally check the profile - based visibility that you set in page variations .
how does this logic work for standard pages ?
and what , pray tell , would be the logic behind pages that show object data ? 252
salesforce winter release notes community builder : where everything is flexible , customizable , and reusable note :  some pages are always public , while others are always private .
public pages include login - related pages ( login , register , forget password , login error , check password ) .
direct message pages are always private .
seo enhancements improve search - engine ranking to improve your community ’s seo ranking , we now redirect non - canonical urls to canonical urls using 301 redirects .
a canonical url lets you tell search engines that slightly different urls , which all point to the same content , are actually the same thing .
a 301 redirect indicates that a url has been permanently moved , which is optimal for seo .
for example , let ’s say you add object pages for the account object .
in this case , the detail page has an object - specific account detail page and a generic record detail page .
when community members access the generic record detail page ( /s / detail / recordid ) , they ’re now permanently redirected to the canonical url of the object - specific account detail page instead ( /s / account / recordid ) .
similarly , we added 301 redirects for list and related list pages .
in addition , we redirect urls for the topic detail and the question detail pages to seo friendly urls .
to create user - readable urls , we add the topic name for topic detail pages , and the question title for question detail pages .
so for example , https://mycommunity.com/s/question/0d5b0000007qtp7kai  now redirects to https://mycommunity.com/s/question/0d5b0000007qtp7kai/need-help-picking-a-grinder .
note :  url redirects occur only when a url is accessed directly from the browser url bar or from a link that ’s external to your community .
page layouts are
now called content layouts with the introduction of custom theme layouts , we ’ve changed the name of page layouts to content layouts for clarity .
content layouts define the content regions of your page , such as a two - column layout with a 2:1 ratio .
we ’ve also removed the custom tab from the new page and the change layout dialog boxes .
after you create a custom content layout component in developer console , you now see both ready - to - use and custom content layouts displayed together in these dialog boxes .

row level actions in list views can help you do just that .
we added edit and delete actions to the list view rows so you can manage your records more effectively without leaving the page .
a list with a view
sometimes you just need to organize things your own way for them to make sense to you .
so , we made it so that any community user can create a list view for objects they have permissions to access .
this is only available in salesforce tabs + visualforce .
the birth of a new list view layout hear my tale of three views .
once there were two view options in communities .
one , called full , was a wide page , showed record details , and scrolled infinitely .
the other , called compact , was a narrow column , showed mainly record titles , and the admin chose the number of records to show at a time .
all was well , but , not one to rest on our laurels , we thought it could be even better .
enter standard .
it has the wider page layout of a full , but the limited record display of compact and minus the row level and list view actions that take up space .
it creates a best of all worlds for pages with lots of components .
changing templates is no longer supported for koa , kokua , and customer service ( napili )
starting with winter , the ability to change templates is supported only for communities that use the salesforce tabs + visualforce template .
we no longer support this functionality for communities that use the koa , kokua , and customer service ( napili ) templates , but the functionality remains available in our ui .

we added support for a bunch of new objects . • activity history • dashboard • email message • external objects • product • report • service appointment • shared contact • work order 258 salesforce winter release notes • work order line item see also : community templates : new components , new topic capabilities , and more salesforce help : objects supported in the customer service template get field - level help in communities community users can now view the same field - level help in communities that ’s available in salesforce classic and lightning experience .
this feature is available in communities made with any template .
if you haven’t already , you can use setup to define custom help for your org ’s standard and custom fields .
see define field - level help in the salesforce help .
previously , the help showed up only in communities built with the salesforce tabs + visualforce template .
expose content from external data sources in your template - driven community picture all your data and content , independent from where they ’re stored , around a campfire , holding hands and singing kumbaya !
yes folks , you can now access external data and content that are stored outside your salesforce org from your customer service ( napili ) template community .
for example , you can let your community users access : • data that ’s stored in another salesforce org , sap® netweaver gateway , or ibm websphere® that your org accesses via salesforce connect • content that ’s stored in google drive or sharepoint that your org accesses via files connect note : • high - data - volume external data sources are n’t supported . •
if the external data source has identity type  set to per user , customer service ( napili ) template community users ca n’t set up their own authentication settings for external systems .
however , you can set up and manage each user ’s authentication settings for external systems from lightning experience or salesforce classic .
how can external data and content be useful in a community setting ?
let ’s say you have a partner community for sales , and you store your product order information in a back - office erp system .
now you can surface that information to your sales partners , enabling them to view and update orders within the context of all related data regardless of where it ’s stored .
exciting , right ?
or maybe you store your templates for contracts and other agreements in ( gasp ) a non - salesforce environment .
now your sales partners can access the latest and greatest of that content as needed .

( what a silly question .
of course they do ! ) partner community members can send emails directly from accounts , contacts , leads , opportunities , and campaigns .
you can even set up email templates in salesforce to send uniform and approved messaging with consistent branding to leads and prospects .
rich text is supported , so add pictures and links to keep your content engaging .

help partners follow your company ’s sales processes with sales path
so you ’ve set up your partner community and it ’s generating leads like crazy .
now you can help your partners adopt and adhere to your company ’s sales processes using the sales path component .
sales path is available for opportunities and leads in communities made with the customer service ( napili ) template .
with your sales operations manager , determine and customize the stages that appear for leads and opportunities .
add fields that matter to your company and include guidance for success .
in your guidance , include details about company policies , tips for establishing positive selling relationships , and even links to relevant feeds .
the sales path appears with the stages you set up .
partners mark stages complete when they ’re ready to move to the next one .
the beauty is that partners focus on only the fields that matter most to your sales managers , so partners qualify leads and close opportunities faster .
when you ’re using the sales path component in the community , keep in mind that is it best intended for a wide - column layout .
try to add it to columns that are at least 50% wide , though full columns are best .
note :  to see sales paths on mobile devices , configure a custom one in your salesforce org .

expand your community to include field service data how cool would it be to use your community to keep customers and field service technicians in the loop about field service work ?
pretty cool , obviously .
you can now use the service appointment , product , work order , and work order line item objects in your community , in addition to previously available objects like asset , account , and contact .
customers can easily schedule appointments , and technicians can check on work orders straight from their community .
adding service appointments and work orders to your community gives your customers or partners helpful visibility into your field service progress .
for example , customers can quickly find out an appointment ’s status and know when to expect the technician .
and letting partners view or update work orders keeps them informed about upcoming work to be performed .
to set up field service objects , make a new object page in page manager in community builder .
when prompted , choose a salesforce field service object ( service appointment , work order , or work order line item ) .
page manager creates three related pages for the new object page : a record detail page , a record list page , and a related list page .
add the objects to your community ’s navigation bar , and you ’re all set .
265 salesforce winter release notes community templates : new components , new topic capabilities , and more tip :  be sure to review the field - level security on these objects so that customers and partners see only the fields that they need to .
for example , on service appointments , you can decide to make the arrival window start and end fields visible , but keep the scheduled start and end fields internal .
note :  only service appointments , products , work orders , and work order line items are available in communities built using the customer service ( napili ) template .

a list with a view
sometimes you just need to organize things your own way for them to make sense to you .
so , we made it so that any community user can create a list view for objects they have permissions to access .
this is only available in salesforce tabs + visualforce .
the birth of a new list view layout hear my tale of three views .
once there were two view options in communities .
one , called full , was a wide page , showed record details , and scrolled infinitely .
the other , called compact , was a narrow column , showed mainly record titles , and the admin chose the number of records to show at a time .
all was well , but , not one to rest on our laurels , we thought it could be even better .
enter standard .
it has the wider page layout of a full , but the limited record display of compact and minus the row level and list view actions that take up space .
it creates a best of all worlds for pages with lots of components .

the same moderation rules your community uses to stop noncompliant or inappropriate posts now apply to comments
. moderators can also change the status value from pending review to published and back again on feed posts and comments .
so set up your moderation rules to review and approve community - member generated content , and relax .
nothing ’s going to get by you .
you can create and manage rules to review content in community management under moderation > rules .
create a content rule , and use review as the moderation action .
you can also use the metadata api or tooling api to set up rules to review and approve posts and comments in the feed .
chatter rest api and chatter in apex support changing the status value of posts and comments from pending review to published and back again .
use premoderation in salesforce tabs + visualforce communities we did n’t want the customer service ( napili ) template to have all the fun , so we made premoderation available on posts and comments in salesforce tabs + visualforce communities , too .

moderate record feeds moderation is no longer bound to the main community feed .
now , moderation rules apply to record feeds as well .
community members can comment on any record types that have a feed , and community moderators can make sure that the discussion stays within the guidelines of their community .
let ’s say your community encourages feedback on particular products .
customers can go to a product and hold a discussion right there .
if the posts or comments do n’t meet the moderation rules criteria , they are caught by the moderation rules configured for your community .
flags on a record feed are only visible from within the community that flags them .
even better , you can turn off moderation rules for internal users so that their feed activity is n’t flagged .
if your support team adds a comment to the same record type , they can help your customers without getting flagged or blocked by moderation rules .

knowing who clicks your recommendations can help you create other recommendations that are not too hot or too cold , but just right .
in community management , select recommendationsrecommendations .
the https://  field supports context variables .
for example , include a { !
userid }  context variable in your url , https://www.example.com / dosurvey?userid={!userid}. when a user clicks the button in the recommendation , salesforce sends the id of that user to your server in the http request .

user profile photos go big and circular we ’re updating the profile pages to make them feel more modern .
so , we added larger , circularly cropped user profile images .
if the cropping does n't look right , users can reupload the photo or upload a new one .
we suggest that you review your users’ profile pics in the sandbox environment before winter goes live just to “ head off ” any potential concerns .
and if you find that the rounded images are n't for your community , you can disable it and keep the rectangular photos .
identify your members with custom community roles and company names in a community , users are often identified by their company name or by “
customer ” or “
partner ” role labels .
in winter ‘ 17 , we updated this “ community role ” feature .

second , we ’ve add a third role : employee .
and finally , the role labels can be customized or turned off .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .

let ’s follow dorothy .
her company uses groups for interacting with customers as well as employees .
dorothy is a member of several groups and has noticed a recurring theme in the comments .
it seems that both customers and employees have lots of questions and ideas about how to use her company ’s weather mapping software to predict the likelihood of tornadoes touching down in a given area .
she decides to create a group just for capturing this discussion in one place .
first things first , she goes to the group list page .
when she clicks the new button , she ’s off and running .
she decides to name her group tornado touchdown ( she ’s a bit of a sports fan , too ) .
in the description box , she puts in a few sentences about her group .
this information is public facing and indexed by search software , so she throws in some key terms to help others find it .
in the information box , she adds a bit more .
this info will be available on the group page and is rich text , so she has a bit of fun with the font size , bold , and so on .
she briefly considers adding links to other groups and sites here , but decides to hold off for now .
she clicks save & next and the group is created .
she can leave the wizard at this step or continue on .
dorothy decides to upload a photo and temporarily use one she took at her aunt ’s farm .
just until she can find a good one of a tornado , of course .

n / a customers are n’t blocked from using salesforce1 on untested devices that meet current platform requirements .
to allow for rapid innovation and to keep salesforce1 current in the rapidly evolving mobile market , the list of salesforce1-tested devices is subject to change at the sole discretion of salesforce , with or without advance notice . salesforce1 updates customers whose devices meet current minimum platform requirements are eligible to receive salesforce1 feature updates and fixes .
our goal is to release salesforce1 feature and functionality updates to coincide with each salesforce major release .
this information is provided to help with your release planning but is subject to change at salesforce ’s discretion .
mobile browser app enhanced features and functionality are automatically available with each salesforce major release .
317 salesforce winter release notes salesforce1 : more doing , more sharing downloadable apps enhanced features and functionality are provided in major version updates .
we aim to release a new major version of the downloadable apps after the completion of each salesforce major release to all production instances .
the timeframe in which a new major version is released varies and may be impacted by factors outside of saleforce ’s control , including new requirements from apple or google or changes to the ios or android operating systems .
customers can install new major and bug fix versions of the downloadable apps from the app store and google play as long as their mobile devices meet salesforce ’s current minimum mobile operating system requirements .
if a device is running an older operating system , updated versions of salesforce1 wo n’t appear in the app stores .
customer support services for salesforce1 salesforce customer support uses commercially reasonable efforts to troubleshoot issues with salesforce1 , provided : • users’ devices meet current minimum platform requirements • downloadable app users have the most recent version of salesforce1 installed when customers run salesforce1 on salesforce - tested devices , it ’s more efficient for us to troubleshoot issues with the mobile app .
for customers using untested devices , even those meeting minimum platform requirements , we may not be able to replicate some issues due to device manufacturer - specific customizations .
running salesforce1 on older devices or devices with low computation and memory capabilities may adversely impact performance of the app , as compared to performance on salesforce - tested devices .
end of support for the salesforce1 mobile browser app on blackberry devices as we first announced in the winter ’16 release notes , support for using the salesforce1 mobile browser app on blackberry 10 devices ends with winter .
for a smooth transition , we recommend switching your blackberry users to the connect to salesforce app , which is available for download from blackberry world .
users are n’t blocked from running the salesforce1 mobile browser app on blackberry z10 or z30 phones .
but salesforce no longer provides technical support , bug fixes , or enhancements for any issues your users may encounter when working on blackberry devices .
advance notice that salesforce1 will require ios 10 in spring with spring , the minimum mobile operating system requirement for ios devices is changing to ios 10 or later .
to ensure a smooth transition , we recommend that your iphone and ipad users update to ios 10 in advance of the spring release .
upgrading is especially important for salesforce1 for ios downloadable app users because the spring version of the app wo n’t appear in the app store for devices with older os versions .
your users can easily install the latest version of ios for free on their iphone and ipad devices .
for help upgrading ios , see update the ios software on your iphone , ipad , and ipod touch on the apple support site .
send text messages from salesforce1 some combinations are a natural fit : peanut butter and jelly , wine and cheese — and now salesforce1 and text messaging .
finally your sales reps can do what ’s natural and send sms text messages to customers and colleagues , without needing to leave the app .
what a time saver to whip out an answer to a lead ’s question or confirm an appointment with an account , right from the record where all the details are .
this feature is available in all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .
there are a few requirements for the new send text action .
• sms messaging must be enabled on the user ’s mobile phone or tablet .
the action uses sms messaging only , not imessage on ios devices . 318 salesforce winter release notes salesforce1 : more doing ,
more sharing •
the record must include a valid phone number .
if there is n’t a phone number field on the record ( for example the phone  field ) or if all phone number fields are empty , the action does n’t appear in the record ’s action bar or action menu .
the send text action switches to the messaging app on the user ’s device , opening a new message to the phone number in the record .
the send text action is available for accounts , contacts , leads , and person accounts ..
by default , the action is included at the end of the salesforce1 and lightning experience actions section on the object ’s page layout .
this organization means that users must open the ) in the action bar to send text messages .
you can streamline access for your reps by moving the action so it appears action menu ( directly in the action bar .
see salesforce1 action bar and customize actions with the enhanced page layout editor in the salesforce help .
change record types in salesforce1 now your salesforce1 users can keep their business moving from the road by updating record types for existing records .
the new change record type action is available from the action bar in all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app . 319 salesforce winter release notes salesforce1 : more doing ,
more sharing list item actions in salesforce1 related lists match those in lightning experience to provide continuity for users who work in both salesforce1 and lightning experience , both interfaces now display the same set of list item actions on items in related lists .
this change appears in all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .
for example , in lightning experience , the actions available in the pull - down menu on an opportunity related list item are the same set of actions that salesforce1 users see when swiping left on the same record in the related list . 320 salesforce winter release notes salesforce1 : more doing , more sharing note :
even if your org does n’t have lightning experience enabled , the actions on related lists that you see in salesforce1 still match the actions that would appear on the related list items in lightning experience if it was enabled .
quickly access contacts , profiles , objects , and apps ( oh my ! ) with ios spotlight search what ’s better than using the salesforce1 mobile app to run your business from anywhere ?
getting direct access to salesforce data without first navigating to it in salesforce1 !
salesforce1 for ios users can now use spotlight search to find recently viewed contacts and chatter profiles .
and users can also search for most salesforce objects and apps , then navigate straight to the associated home pages in salesforce1 with just a quick tap .
using spotlight search to locate salesforce data is available in version 11.0 or later of the salesforce1 for ios downloadable app .
salesforce1 for ios works with spotlight search so that up to 200 of a user ’s most recently accessed contacts and 200 most recently accessed chatter profiles are indexed for availability in search results .
users simply enter what they ’re looking for in the spotlight search field , such as a first or last name , job title , or company name .
users can even enter an account name to find recent contacts related to the account .
tap a contact or profile in search results to switch to that record in salesforce1 .
321 salesforce winter release notes salesforce1 : more doing , more sharing depending on your org , the salesforce1 navigation menu may include many items , meaning your users have to scroll a lot each time they want to find something specific .
now , when a user wants to see their opportunities , dashboards , chatter feed , or most other standard and custom objects and apps available to them in salesforce1 , they can navigate straight to the desired home page from spotlight search results .
for example , enter opportunities  in the spotlight search field .
then tap opportunities in the search results to open the opportunities home page in salesforce1 .
there are a few considerations for this feature . •
if your org employs any of these security measures , finding salesforce data in spotlight search is disabled and ca n’t be turned on . –
salesforce1 requires a pin code to log in . –
offline caching in salesforce1 is disabled . •
spotlight search returns results for most items in the salesforce1 navigation menu .
the only exceptions are visualforce tabs and lightning page tabs , which are n’t supported in spotlight search . •
if a user has multiple accounts set up in the salesforce1 switcher , search results are for the currently active account only . • spotlight search indexes salesforce data only when salesforce1 is in the background .
if a user switches back to salesforce1 before indexing is complete , they may not see all the search results they expect .
see more relevant instant results in lookup searches in salesforce1 if a related lookup filter was added to a field , the filter is now applied to instant results in salesforce1 .
instant results are recent items or record suggestions based on what the user is typing .
previously , the mobile app applied the related lookup filter only to full lookup search results .
this feature is available in all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .
related lookup filters are admin - set filters that restrict the valid values and search results for lookup fields for enhanced lookup searches .
for example , you can configure the account owner lookup field to show only active users on the same record .
note :  dependent lookup filters are n’t supported .
dependent lookup filters are admin - set filters that reference fields on the current object record ( the source ) for enhanced lookup searches .
for example , you can configure the case contact field to show only contacts associated with the account selected in the case account name field on the same record . 322 salesforce winter release notes salesforce1 : more doing , more sharing account insights now called news and available in more places in salesforce1 first it was account news , then account insights — now it 's news .

note :  when your salesforce1 users upgrade to a version 11.0 downloadable app , their existing offline cache is erased .

work with recently accessed record types salesforce1 now caches up to 15 of the user ’s most recently accessed record types per object .
previously , salesforce1 cached the first 15 record types for an object , whether or not the user had recently worked with the record types .
this limitation meant that offline users could find themselves unable to create or edit some of their recently accessed record types .

note :  the salesforce1 connected app packages must be installed before you can configure the new security settings .

many of these attributes have a default value that automatically applies when your users log in to a version 11.0 app for the first time .

the attribute value you enter depends on the email app and the device platform . •
for android , use the uri listed in the google play store for the desired email app . •
for ios , do an internet search to locate the uri scheme for the desired email app .
for example , search for ios mail uri scheme . •

if set to false , disables printing from salesforce1 .
tip :  connected app attribute changes take effect when users force quit salesforce1 or when they log in to a new session .
to ensure that new or modified settings take effect for all users , we recommend that you revoke access to salesforce1 so everyone is required to log in again .
we also recommend that you warn users about the changes you intend to make , especially if you ’re going to restrict activities that were previously available .

streamline picklist maintenance with global picklists ( generally available ) efficiently share values across custom picklists on multiple objects by creating picklist fields that use a global value set .
global picklists are always restricted , so your picklist data stays clean because users ca n’t add erroneous or redundant values through the api .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
note :  to provide feedback or suggestions for global picklists , visit the global , restricted custom picklists group in the salesforce success community .
a global picklist is a restricted picklist by definition .
when you create a global picklist , the list of values you specify is protected .
only you can add or edit values .
when you create a custom picklist field and base it on the global picklist , its list of values is inherited from the global picklist .
users ca n’t change the values because they ’re defined as a picklist value set .
they also ca n’t add values through the api to the value set or to picklist fields that use it .
conveniently create a global picklist from setup .
then create custom picklist fields the way you always have .
but now you have the option of using a global value set for as many custom picklists as you want .
picklist value sets node in setup ( salesforce classic ) 381
salesforce winter release notes picklist administration : easier value maintenance , enhanced api , global picklists in lightning experience picklist value sets in setup ( lightning experience ) specify the picklist value set when you create a global picklist .
if you edit the global picklist definition , all of the picklist fields that use its picklist value set are also updated .
say you want a picklist field called “ rating ” on accounts and opportunities , with values hot , warm , and cool .
instead of maintaining those picklist values separately on two different objects , create a picklist value set with your values .
then create a picklist field on each object , and set those picklists to inherit the global picklist value set you have created .

you can now make a local , custom picklist dependent on a local , custom picklist that uses a global value set .
the global value set is defined in one place and shared .
use that value set for as many local , custom picklists — and their dependent picklists — as you need .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
for example , your business has four large warehouses and ships orders all over the united states .
you want to select which warehouse to use for customer accounts based on the customer ’s region .
so you make the account territory field the controlling field for the warehouse location field on accounts . 384 salesforce winter release notes picklist administration : easier value maintenance , enhanced api , global picklists in lightning experience
but wait — the account territory picklist inherits its values from a global value set named territory .
so you ca n’t use it as a controlling field , right ?
no problem .
we ’ve said “
so long ” to another picklist limitation .
you can make account territory the controlling field for any custom picklist , like warehouse location .
select which picklist values you want to display for each account territory ( or region ) .
for example , if a rep selects northeast ( 1 ) as the account territory , only philadelphia , pa ( 2 ) appears as a possible warehouse location .
save , and you ’re done .
replace values from global picklists
now you have even more flexibility for keeping picklist field values current on existing records .
conveniently replace a value in a custom picklist that uses a global value set .
previously , you could n’t do this kind of field - level replace on shared picklists .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .

other times it ’s not enough .
now you can switch a custom picklist that uses a global value set from multi - select to single - select , or vice versa , right from the user interface .
enjoy the flexibility in fine - tuning your data .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
for example , it turns out that an account can occupy more than one territory .

no need to totally delete values before you ’re ready . deactivating a value
does n’t disrupt the existing records that use that picklist value .
when you no longer need the value for future records , you can delete it .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
when you deactivate a value , it no longer appears in the picklist that users select from when creating or editing a record .
let ’s say you want to hide a picklist value .
first , navigate to the picklist definition . •
for a picklist on an object , go to the fields area of the object .
for example , for an account picklist : from setup , enter account  in the quick find  box , then select fields under accounts . •
for a global picklist : from setup , enter picklist  in the quick find  box , then select picklists .
then go to the picklist ’s detail page .
remove the value from future use by clicking deactivate next to its name .
the value moves to the inactive picklist values section .
if you decide later that you need the value , click activate next to the value ’s name .
when you change a picklist value , the action is logged in setup audit trail .
the log entries for deactivate actions now say that the value was deactivated .
previously , it was tricky to distinguish deactivated values from deleted values in global and custom unrestricted picklists because the action involved a delete command .
make an existing custom picklist required reduce empty picklist fields and skewed data by making custom picklist fields required .
you can set any custom picklist field to be required when you create it , or modify an existing custom picklist field .

winter release notes sharing : more granular and efficient recalculation sharing : more granular and efficient recalculation recalculate sharing rules on a per - object basis with object - specific share locks .
recalculate org - wide defaults more efficiently with asynchronous parallel recalculation .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
in
this section : editions available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions update sharing rules with object - specific share locks ( generally available ) object - specific share locks enable you to make changes to sharing rules for multiple objects simultaneously , depending on the objects affected by the sharing rules , sharing rule type , and target groups or roles of the affected users .
update org - wide defaults with asynchronous parallel recalculation ( pilot ) when you update an org - wide default , recalculation is now processed asynchronously and in parallel .
this change provides optimal efficiency of server resources and guards against site operations such as patches and server restarts .
your org must have object - specific share locks enabled , which is available to all new and existing orgs in winter .
update sharing rules with object - specific share locks ( generally available ) object - specific share locks enable you to make changes to sharing rules for multiple objects simultaneously , depending on the objects affected by the sharing rules , sharing rule type , and target groups or roles of the affected users .
note :  this feature was previously available to select customers through a pilot program .
in winter ‘ 17 , the feature is enabled for both new and existing orgs .
administrators or users with the “ manage sharing ” permission can use this feature when working with sharing rules .
criteria - based and ownership - based sharing rules recalculation is run if a sharing rule has changed or when you click the recalculate button on the sharing settings page . clicking this button locks sharing rules for that object ( 1 ) , but you can still make changes to sharing rules for another object .
note :  use the recalculate buttons on the sharing rules related lists only if sharing rule updates have failed or are not working as expected .
when recalculation for an ownership - based sharing rule is in progress , you ca n’t create , edit , or delete ownership - based sharing rules for that object targeting the same group of users .
for example , let ’s say you ’re creating an ownership - based lead sharing rule targeting the all internal users group .
while recalculation is in progress , you can create another ownership - based sharing rule for 394 salesforce
winter release notes sharing : more granular and efficient recalculation leads targeting any other public group except the all internal users group .
you can create , update , or delete ownership - based sharing rules for leads targeting all internal users only after the recalculation finishes .
you receive an email notification when the recalculation is complete .
when recalculation for a criteria - based sharing rule is in progress , you ca n’t edit or delete that rule .
but you can create , edit , or delete any other criteria - based or ownership - based sharing rule for that object regardless of the target group of users .
note :  you ca n’t modify the org - wide defaults when a sharing rule recalculation for any object is in progress .
similarly , you ca n’t modify sharing rules when recalculation for an org - wide default update is in progress .
account , cases , contacts , and opportunities sharing rules can affect accounts and the associated account children — cases , contacts , and opportunities —
so they are locked together to ensure that recalculation runs properly .
for example , creating or editing an account sharing rule prevents you from creating or editing a case , contact , or opportunity sharing rule .
similarly , creating or editing an opportunity sharing rule prevents you from creating or editing a case , contact , or account sharing rule before recalculation is complete .
locks are not shared across objects , except across accounts and associated account children .
note :  clicking the recalculate button for any of these four objects’ sharing rules prevents anyone from making changes to sharing rules for those objects until recalculation finishes .
in the following example , an ownership - based account sharing rule has been deleted and recalculation is in progress .
although you ca n’t create , edit , or delete another ownership - based sharing rule for any of these objects , you can make changes to a criteria - based sharing rule ( 2 ) for those objects .
395 salesforce winter release notes general administration : lightning component actions update org - wide defaults with asynchronous parallel recalculation ( pilot ) when you update an org - wide default , recalculation is now processed asynchronously and in parallel .
this change provides optimal efficiency of server resources and guards against site operations such as patches and server restarts .

note :  we provide asynchronous parallel recalculation of org - wide defaults to selected customers through a pilot program that requires agreement to specific terms and conditions .
to be nominated to participate in the program , contact salesforce .
pilot programs are subject to change , and we ca n’t guarantee acceptance .
the asynchronous parallel recalculation of org - wide defaults is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
we ca n’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all .
make your purchase decisions only based on generally available products and features .
you can provide feedback and suggestions for the asynchronous parallel recalculation of org - wide defaults in the ideaexchange .
you receive an email notification when the recalculation is completed .
consider the following guidelines when updating your org - wide defaults . •
while recalculation is in progress , you ca n’t create , update , or delete sharing rules and org - wide defaults for that object .
however , you can make changes to the org - wide default and sharing rules for another object .
• updating the org - wide default on an account or its children — cases , contacts , and opportunities —
disables further org - wide default and sharing rule updates on them .
for example , when you update the opportunity org - wide default and recalculation is in progress , you ca n’t update the org - wide default or sharing rules for accounts , contacts , opportunities , and cases .

401 salesforce winter release notes authentication and identity : quicker logins , connected apps enhancements , more authentication options external identity app launcher has a new look if you set up salesforce identity for your customers or partners ( referred to as external identity ) , you probably used the aloha communities template with the app launcher .
when winter ' 17 releases , your app launcher takes on the fresh look of our redesigned app launcher .
let users verify their identity with u2f security keys your users can now use a u2f security key anytime they ’re challenged to verify their identity , including two - factor authentication and device activations .
instead of using salesforce authenticator or one - time passwords sent by email or sms , users insert their u2f security key into a usb port to complete verification .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
restrict location - based automated verifications with salesforce authenticator for more control , you have new options to restrict the use of location - based automated verifications when users authenticate with the salesforce authenticator mobile app .
previously , we allowed automated verification from all locations , and still do so by default .
now , you can choose to restrict use to trusted ip addresses only or to disable it completely .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
let users connect multiple authentication apps your users can now connect a second one - time password generator app to their salesforce accounts , in addition to connecting salesforce authenticator .
some users prefer the flexibility of using either salesforce authenticator or a third - party app , such as google authenticator , on their mobile devices .
they can now use that second app to generate time - based one - time passwords for two - factor authentication and identity verification .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
more id token options for authenticating connected apps for connected apps that use oauth to authenticate with salesforce , you ’re now able to configure the id token in the oauth request .
we can include the id token when a refresh token is returned .
and you can control whether to include standard claims , custom attributes , and custom permissions in the id token for both access and refresh token responses .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
successfully reauthorize your users when provisioning connected apps for those customers using salesforce provisioning for connected apps , we ’ve improved how we handle users that you have reauthorized after unauthorizing them .
previously , reauthorizing a user would trigger a create event , which could cause an error since the user already existed .
salesforce now reactivates the existing user .
log in password - free with lightning login passwords get the job done , helping to secure your salesforce org .

look for the lightning bolt next to your lightning login – enabled username , and click your username . 2 .
tap —
on your mobile device , tap the notification from the salesforce authenticator app .
3 . touch — verify your identity with your fingerprint or pin .
presto !
you ’re logged in .
password - free logins rely on salesforce authenticator ( version 2 or later ) , the two - factor authentication mobile app that ’s available as a free download for ios and android devices .
not only are we making logins more convenient , we ’re adding a layer of security by requiring two factors of authentication for every lightning login .
the first factor is something that the user has — a mobile device that has salesforce authenticator installed and connected with the user ’s salesforce account .
the second factor is something that the user is , such as a fingerprint , or something that the user knows , such as a pin .
the second level of authentication enhances security by requiring access to the mobile device and the user ’s fingerprint or pin .
setting up and educating your users is also simple . •
enable lightning login for your users by assigning them the “ lightning login user ” permission using profiles ( cloned or custom profiles only ) or permission sets .
lightning login is n’t supported for external users .
• lightning login is n’t limited to orgs using lightning experience .
it works in salesforce classic , too . •
each user who has the required permission enrolls individually in lightning login .
on the user ’s advanced user details page , clicking enroll prompts a notification on the user ’s mobile device .
a tap to approve and a fingerprint or pin to authenticate completes the enrollment .
for users who are n’t already using salesforce authenticator , enrollment includes a few extra steps .
users are guided through downloading and installing salesforce authenticator , connecting it to their salesforce account , and setting up the second factor ( fingerprint or pin ) .
• enrolled users are also able to log in by entering only their username , skipping the password field , and clicking log in . •
while enrolled , if users are ever without their mobile device , they can still log in with their password .
if users disconnect salesforce authenticator from their salesforce account , lightning login is n’t allowed until they connect it again . •
users can cancel their own enrollment at any time .
an admin can cancel any individual user ’s enrollment ( although an admin ca n’t enroll on behalf of a user ) . •
to monitor your users’ lightning login usage , use salesforce ’s login history or identity verification history tools to fine - tune your roll - out .
403 salesforce winter release notes authentication and identity : quicker logins , connected apps enhancements , more authentication options in your org ’s session settings , the allow lightning login  setting makes lightning login available , although no one can enroll until you assign them the “ lightning login user ” user permission .
you can disable allow lightning login  at any time , to switch all users back to username and password logins .
the lightning login method is assigned the standard security level by default .
a lightning login establishes a standard security level for the user ’s session , which is the default security level for the username password method that lightning login typically replaces .
if needed , you can change the security level to high assurance .
as you plan your lightning login roll - out , keep these things in mind .
• lightning login is generally available as of october 15 , 2016 .
before then , it ’s not available in sandboxes . •
the salesforce authenticator ( version 2 or later ) mobile app is required .
if your org is n’t already using it , review the requirements , support , and considerations for the app .

security keys can look similar to other usb authentication devices that users carry on a keychain .
try to look for the fido u2f logo indicating that the device is compatible with the u2f protocol .
if you ’re not sure , verify with your security hardware vendor that their keys are u2f compliant . •
security keys are n’t a biometric device , even though some have a button that requires the user ’s touch to activate the device .
your users who have registered u2f security keys get to breeze through the identity verification process . 1 .
enter your username and password . 2 .
insert your security key into the computer ’s usb port .
if there ’s a button , touch the button .
3 .
the security key generates the required credentials , and the browser passes them on to salesforce to complete the verification .
note :  as of winter , this identity verification method is supported only in google chrome version 41 or later because it ’s the only browser that natively supports u2f. ready to implement this secure , convenient identity verification method ?
first , enable the security key ( u2f ) method in your org ’s session settings .
then , encourage your users to individually register their security keys .
on the user ’s advanced user details page , clicking register prompts the user to log in and insert a u2f security key into the computer ’s usb port .
a tap of the button — if the security key has a button — completes the registration .
if your org has deployed my domain , you have access to the setting to enable u2f security keys .
if your org has not deployed my domain , contact salesforce to request access .
enabling my domain after you ’ve enabled u2f invalidates existing registrations for users who registered security keys with your original salesforce domain .
keep in mind that affected users’ registrations must be removed and users must register again with your custom domain name .
after registration , if users are ever without their security key , they can still use salesforce authenticator , any previously registered verification method that generates a verification code , or a temporary verification code generated by an admin .
users can cancel their own registration at any time .
an admin can cancel any individual user ’s registration ( although an admin ca n’t register on behalf of a user ) .
as with other identity verification methods , you can use standard tools in salesforce to track users’ security key usage . •
view users’ security key activity on the identity verification history page . •
monitor security key adoption using the identity verification methods report ( via the link on the identity verification history page ) .
• create user list views that include the has u2f security key  field to see who has registered this method .

411 salesforce winter release notes salesforce shield : bring your own encryption key , resource metering “ view encrypted data ” permission not needed with shield platform encryption beginning spring ‘
17
beginning in spring , you can control who sees encrypted data using the same permission sets , profiles , and field - level security settings that you use to secure your non - encrypted data .
when this change takes place , you will no longer be able to use the “ view encrypted data ” permission to control who sees unmasked encrypted field values .
instead , all users with read access for a field or record will see its contents in the presentation layer in plaintext when it ’s encrypted at rest .
users who do n’t have access to a field , record , or object wo n’t see that information , whether it ’s encrypted or not .
this future update decouples masking capabilities from shield platform encryption .
trust is our top priority .
while our out - of - the - box field- and object - level controls secure access to specific fields , records , and objects , encryption puts a wrapper around your entire org .
think of it like a castle : moats protect the castle , securing everything inside .
but those you welcome into the castle might not be able to enter certain rooms because they do n’t have the keys to the doors .
similarly , encryption adds yet another level of security to your data at rest , and field - level security limits access to specific users and information .
this change does n’t affect classic encryption .
if you have questions about how this change impacts you and your org , or how to prepare for this change , contact your salesforce account executive .
introducing the bring your own key service ( generally available ) the shield platform encryption bring your own key ( byok ) service gives you the option to generate and manage your own tenant secrets outside salesforce , for added control and flexibility .
with the byok service , you have two options to manage your encryption key life cycle : use the built - in salesforce key management infrastructure or use your own cryptographic resources to generate tenant secrets and share them individually with salesforce .
when you bring your own key , you get the security benefits built into the shield platform encryption service plus the control that comes from exclusively managing your tenant secret .
you can generate and store your tenant secrets outside of salesforce using your own crypto libraries , hardware security module ( hsm ) , or key brokering service .
we ’ve partnered with leading third - party key brokering companies to give you even more ways to reduce complexity , administration , and governance efforts .
these key brokering services are optional .
byok is built with security and flexibility in mind .
you can encrypt your tenant secret with a self - signed or certificate authority ( ca ) certificate ’s public key .
uploading your secret to salesforce grants the shield platform encryption key management machinery access to your tenant secret .
your tenant secret is then stored securely in the database , ready for key derivation .
you can revoke access to your tenant secret at will and update your tenant secret on your own schedule .
encrypt your search index ( generally available )
until now , your org 's search indexes were n't encrypted when you applied encryption to fields .
now they are .
when enabled , search index encryption runs when shield platform encryption is in use , leveraging our hsm - based key derivation architecture , metadata , and configurations .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
salesforce applies strong encryption on your org - specific search index .fdt , .tim , and .tip
file types , using an org - specific aes-256-bit encryption key .
search index encryption provides seamless additional protection .
your org ’s encryption policy determines access to this feature , so you do n’t have to change any of your org ’s settings .
to activate search index encryption , contact salesforce support .

policies are metered for uniform resource use .
if a user ’s policy requests ca n’t be handled quickly enough , a fail - close behavior occurs and access is blocked .
the result is that the user is denied access to the resource or entity .
here ’s an example of how metering works for login policies .
your org has a login policy with a notification action .
a user makes four login requests concurrently .
for some reason , the four login policies ca n’t all be executed in sufficient time .
transaction security stops processing the policies and fails closed , blocking all four login requests .
because the policy evaluations did n’t finish , no notifications are sent .
note :  with metering , you ca n’t use static local variables in the apex code for your policies .
more efficient login policies login policies now make better use of computer resources , saving time and helping ensure that every login has the proper policies applied .
your users will have fewer login requests blocked unnecessarily .
monitor usage with transaction security log events the new transaction security event type in event log files lets you easily see your policy volume and usage .
you can also analyze transaction security events with the salesforce analytics tools .
here is an example transaction security event . " transactionsecurity","20160728000023.195","","","","00dd00000008jzr " , " 005d0000001c54j","23","12","","","","","0nid00000004cve","2016 - 07 - 28t00:00:22.916z " , " triggered","6","2016 - 07 - 28t00:00:23.195z","005d0000001c54jiaa","","0nid00000004cveoam " there are id values for the org , the user that caused the event , and the policy invoked .
also included are timestamps , execution times , and whether the policy was triggered .

this section : metadata relationship fields
now fully supported ( generally available ) relationship fields for custom metadata types are fully supported in your production environment .
use metadata relationship fields to look up records of other custom metadata types .
they work just like a configuration record of a custom object , which can look up a record of another custom object that contains application configuration data .
but because they are custom metadata types , they act like true application configuration data rather than just business data .
you can also look up entitydefinitions , the objects that provide row - based access to metadata about standard and custom objects .
metadata relationship fields to entitydefinition show up as links in list view results you can now easily navigate between related custom metadata records by creating list views with relationship fields .
when you query custom metadata records with this list view , the relationship field value displays as a link that takes you to the management page of the referenced object or record .
previously , if the relationship field referenced an entitydefinition , you had to navigate the setup tree to find the referenced objects .
do more with the custom metadata loader you can now update existing records of a custom metadata type using the custom metadata loader .
previously , you could only bulk - load new records .
easily manage a custom metadata record when deleting its referenced object if you try to delete a custom object that is referenced by a relationship field of a custom metadata record , setup correctly returns an error .
setup now also displays links to the referencing custom metadata record .
previously , setup provided only a text list of the records , and you had to manually navigate the setup tree to delete or update them .
view filtering on metadata relationship fields has changed when you create a view to search for custom metadata records , you can define a filter on a metadata relationship field .
the way you specify the filter value , however , has changed from the pilot release for two cases .
all is not lost —
restore deleted metadata relationship fields deleted relationship fields of a custom metadata type are now stored until your org permanently deletes them or 15 days has elapsed , whichever happens first .
until that time , you can restore the field .
the relationship field ’s data is also restored , unless the referenced object no longer exists .
this behavior is similar to that of regular custom fields .
limitations when querying custom metadata types with soql this release includes exciting updates to custom metadata types , but it also brings a few limitations when using soql to query a relationship field . 427 salesforce winter release notes custom metadata types : relationship field updates , loader enhancements , management of deleted metadata metadata relationship fields

428 salesforce winter release notes apex code
all is not lost —
restore deleted metadata relationship fields deleted relationship fields of a custom metadata type are now stored until your org permanently deletes them or 15 days has elapsed , whichever happens first .
until that time , you can restore the field .
the relationship field ’s data is also restored , unless the referenced object no longer exists .
this behavior is similar to that of regular custom fields .
for example , assume that you have a custom metadata record with the relationship field myrelfield  that references the custom metadata record myrecord .
you delete myrelfield  and then delete myrecord .
if you restore myrelfield , the field value for the record that referenced the now - deleted myrecord is null .
this behavior is also true for relationship fields of type entitydefinition .
limitations when querying custom metadata types with soql this release includes exciting updates to custom metadata types , but it also brings a few limitations when using soql to query a relationship field .
you ca n’t use the order by clause on a relationship field of a custom metadata type .
soql and setup ( or metadata api ) queries sometimes behave differently .
if you use soql to query a custom metadata type , the results include only those records that reference objects you have permission to access .
however , a similar query within setup or using the metadata api results in all relevant records , including records that reference objects you ca n’t access .
soql limits apply when querying custom metadata types .
when you execute a join query to an entitydefinition object , the query counts toward your apex transaction soql query limit .
if you join to another custom metadata type , however , the query does n’t count toward your limit .

note :  we provide the apex stub api to selected customers through a pilot program that requires agreement to specific terms and conditions .
the apex stub api is subject to change and is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
we ca n’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all .
make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available products and features .
a mocking framework has many benefits .
it can streamline and improve testing and help you create faster , more reliable tests .
you can use it to test classes in isolation , which is important for unit testing .
building your mocking framework with the stub api can also be beneficial because stub objects are generated at runtime .
because these objects are generated dynamically , you do n’t have to package and deploy test classes .
to use a stub version of an apex class : • define the behavior of the stub class by implementing the system .
stubprovider  interface .
• instantiate a stub object by using the system .
test.createstub ( )  method .
• invoke the relevant method of the stub object from within a test class .
note :  this feature is intended for advanced apex developers .
using it requires a thorough understanding of unit testing and mocking frameworks .
if you think that a mocking framework is something that makes fun of you , you might want to do a little more research before reading further .
monitor platform cache with diagnostic methods platform cache now provides new methods for monitoring how your cache is being used .
the new apex methods allow you to monitor the following values for org cache , session cache , and partitions .

connectapi ( chatter in apex ) create custom experiences in salesforce using chatter in apex .
in this release , you can flag posts and comments as inappropriate or spam , include rich text and inline images in your comments , provide article and file recommendations to guest users , and more .
many chatter rest api resource actions are exposed as static methods on apex classes in the connectapi  namespace .
these methods use other connectapi  classes to input and return information .
the connectapi  namespace is referred to as chatter in apex .
in apex , it ’s possible to access some chatter data using soql queries and objects .
however , connectapi  classes expose chatter data in a much simpler way .
data is localized and structured for display .
for example , instead of making many calls to access and assemble a feed , you can do it with a single call .
note :  to integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third - party web applications with chatter and communities , use chatter rest api . 436 salesforce winter release notes apex code in

use the framework to build mobile apps and pages in lightning experience , salesforce1 , salesforce classic , and communities .
enhancements in this release are focused on customizing lightning experience and salesforce1 with custom actions , a more sophisticated event bubbling model , and improved access to the lightning design system .
it also includes previously announced security changes , including a delay in enforcement for lockerservice .
this feature is available in lightning experience and all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .
editions available for use in : contact manager , group , professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions create lightning components using the ui in enterprise , performance , unlimited , developer editions or a sandbox .
use out - of - the - box components or build your own components with javascript , html , css , apex , or any web - enabled code .
the appexchange for components enables you to install components created by salesforce partners or publish your own components .
for more information , refer to the lightning components developer guide .
in
this section : introducing base lightning components base lightning components are the building blocks that make up the modern lightning experience , salesforce1 , and lightning communities user interfaces .
introducing lightning data service ( developer preview ) use lightning data service to load , create , edit , or delete a record in your component , without requiring apex code .
lightning data service handles sharing rules and field level security for you .
in addition to not needing apex , lightning data service improves performance and user interface consistency .
enable lightning components for custom actions add the force : lightningquickaction  or force : lightningquickactionwithoutheader  interface to a lightning component to enable it to be used as a custom action in lightning experience or salesforce1 .
you can use components that implement one of these interfaces as object - specific actions in both lightning experience and salesforce1 .
you can use them as global actions only in salesforce1 .
access check violations are now enforced access check enforcement was a critical update in summer ’16 and will be enforced for all orgs sometime between october 15 and october 19 , 2016 .
improved access check enforcement for lightning resources enables component authors to have greater control over how their components are used .
lockerservice critical update postponed lockerservice is a powerful security architecture for lightning components that was a critical update for summer ’16 .
this critical update was scheduled for auto - activation in winter .
the auto - activation date has been postponed until summer .
all orgs can toggle the lockerservice critical update
previously , some orgs did n't have the option to deactivate the critical update without contacting salesforce .
since the critical update has been extended until summer ' 17 , we 've simplified this process so that these orgs can now deactivate the critical update .
also , there is a new setting on the lightning components setup page to let you control whether lockerservice is enforced for components installed from a managed package .
there is no behavior change for lockerservice enforcement for existing orgs .
capture events before they bubble up and away the lightning component framework supports a new capture phase for component and application events .
previously , the framework only supported a bubble phase for component events .
the framework now also supports the bubble phase for application events .
these phases are similar to dom handling patterns and provide an opportunity for interested components to interact with an event and potentially control the behavior for subsequent handlers .
441 salesforce winter release notes lightning components : actions , events , styles , and security handle bubbled events in container components some components contain other components but are n’t the owner of those components .
these components are known as container components .
you can now handle captured or bubbled events in container components .
this feature paves the way for wrapper components that provide event handling behavior around their dynamic content , enabling new patterns for component design , composition , and reuse .
events from dynamically created components propagate properly before winter , if you created a component programmatically using $ a.createcomponent ( ) , events did n’t propagate to the component ’s containment hierarchy .
this bug meant that there was a difference in event propagation behavior depending on whether the event was fired in a component created in markup versus code .
in winter , we fixed event propagation behavior so that components created programmatically in code behave the same way as components created declaratively in markup .
use the lightning design system in lightning apps use the lightning design system to style your lightning apps by extending force : slds  or using a static resource .
the salesforce lightning design system provides a look and feel that ’s consistent with lightning experience .
use lightning design system styles to give your custom applications a ui that is consistent with salesforce , without having to reverse - engineer our styles .
create a consistent look with the lightning design system in lightning out and lightning components for visualforce the lightning design system is now automatically added to your lightning out and lightning components for visualforce apps .
the lightning design system provides a look and feel that ’s consistent with lightning experience .
restrict your custom lightning components to specific objects if you have a custom lightning component bundle designed for use on lightning pages , add the new < sfdc : object >  tag set to the .design file to restrict the component only to certain objects .
navigate from a lightning component to another ( beta )
the force : navigatetocomponent event enables you navigate to another component easily within salesforce1 and lightning experience .
debug lightning components faster and easier with salesforce lightning inspector get component descriptions from more product areas , see transactions graphically , review event call stacks , and get the salesforce lightning inspector devtools extension in more languages .
new and changed lightning components components help you build apps faster .
use them in your lightning apps or in salesforce1 .
new lightning events events add a layer of interaction to your components .
introducing base lightning components base lightning components are the building blocks that make up the modern lightning experience , salesforce1 , and lightning communities user interfaces .
base lightning components incorporate lightning design system markup and classes , providing improved performance and accessibility with a minimum footprint .
these base components handle the details of html and css for you .
each component provides simple attributes that enable variations in style .
this means that you typically do n’t need to use css at all .
the simplicity of the base lightning component attributes and their clean and consistent definitions make them easy to use , enabling you to focus on your business logic . you can find base lightning components in the lightning  namespace to complement the existing ui  namespace components .
in instances where there are matching ui  and lightning  namespace components , we recommend that you use the lightning namespace component .
the lightning  namespace components are optimized for common use cases .
beyond being equipped with the lightning design system styling , they handle accessibility , real - time interaction , and enhanced error messages . 442 salesforce winter release notes lightning components : actions , events , styles , and security
in subsequent releases , we intend to provide additional base lightning components .
we expect that in time the lightning namespace will have parity with the ui  namespace and go beyond it .
in addition , the base lightning components will evolve with the lightning design system over time .
this ensures that your customizations continue to match lightning experience and salesforce1 .
note :  this release contains a beta version of a few components that are production quality but have known limitations .
this feature is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press release or public statements .
we ca n’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all .
make your purchase decisions only based on generally available products and features .
you can provide feedback and suggestions for this feature in the ideaexchange .

this section : base lightning components considerations learn about the guidelines on using the base lightning components .
base lightning components considerations learn about the guidelines on using the base lightning components .
we recommend that you do n't depend on the markup of a lightning component as its internals can change in the future .
for example , using cmp.get("v.body " )  and examining the dom elements can wreak havoc should the component markup change down the road .
with lockerservice enforced , you wo n't be able to traverse the dom for components you do n't own .
instead of accessing the dom tree , you can rely on the component tree and take advantage of value binding with component attributes .
for example , you 'll go far with cmp.find("myinput").get("v.name " )  instead of cmp.find("myinput").getelement().name .
many of the base lightning components are still evolving and the following considerations can help you while you ’re building your apps .
lightning : buttonmenu ( beta ) this component contains menu items that are created only if the button is triggered .
you wo n’t be able to reference the menu items during initialization or if the button is n’t triggered yet .
lightning : formatteddatetime ( beta ) this component provides fallback behavior in apple safari 10 and below .
the following formatting options have exceptions when using the fallback behavior in older browsers . •
era  is not supported . •
timezonename  appends gmt  for short format , gmt - h : mm  or gmt+h : mm  for long format . •
timezone  supports utc .
if another timezone value is used , lightning : formatteddatetime  uses the browser timezone . lightning : formattednumber ( beta ) this component provides the following fallback behavior in apple safari 10 and below . •
if style  is set to currency , providing a currencycode value that ’s different from the locale displays the currency code instead of the symbol .
the following example displays eur12.34 in fallback mode and € 12.34 otherwise .
< lightning : formattednumber value="12.34 " style="currency " currencycode="eur"/ > • currencydisplayas  supports symbol  only .
the following example displays $ 12.34  in fallback mode only if the currencycode  matches the user ’s locale currency and usd12.34 otherwise .
< lightning : formattednumber value="12.34 " style="currency " currencycode="usd " currencydisplayas="symbol"/ > lightning : input ( beta ) the file  type is not supported .
also , date pickers are available in the following components but they do n’t inherit the lightning design system styling . •
< lightning : input type="date " / > •
< lightning : input type="datetime - local " / > fields for percentage and currency input must specify a step increment of 0.01 as required by the native implementation .
< lightning : input type="number " name="percentval " label="enter a percentage value " formatter="percent " step="0.01 " / > 445 salesforce winter release notes lightning components : actions , events , styles , and security < lightning : input type="number " name="currencyval " label="enter a dollar amount " formatter="currency " step="0.01 " / > when working with checkboxes , radio buttons , and toggle switches , use aura : id  to group and traverse the array of components
. grouping them enables you to use get("v.checked " )  to determine which elements are checked or unchecked without reaching into the dom .
you can also use the name  and value  attributes to identify each component during the iteration .
the following example groups three checkboxes together using aura : id .
< aura : component > < form > < fieldset > < legend > select your favorite color:</legend > < lightning : input type="checkbox " label="red " name="color1 " value="1 " aura : id="colors"/ > < lightning : input type="checkbox " label="blue " name="color2 " value="2 " aura : id="colors"/ > < lightning : input type="checkbox " label="green " name="color3 " value="3 " aura : id="colors"/ > <

in your client - side controller , you can retrieve the array using cmp.find("colors " )  and inspect the checked  values .
lightning : tab ( beta ) this component creates its body during runtime .
you wo n’t be able to reference the component during initialization .
referencing the component using aura : id  might return unexpected results , such as the component returning an undefined value when implementing cmp.find("mycomponent " ) . lightning : tabset ( beta ) when you load more tabs than can fit the width of the viewport , the tabset provides navigation buttons that scrolls horizontally to display the overflow tabs .
introducing lightning data service ( developer preview ) use lightning data service to load , create , edit , or delete a record in your component , without requiring apex code .
lightning data service handles sharing rules and field level security for you .
in addition to not needing apex , lightning data service improves performance and user interface consistency .
note : lightning data service is available as a developer preview .
lightning data service is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
you can provide feedback and suggestions for lightning data service on the ideaexchange .
editions available in : developer edition at the simplest level , you can think of lightning data service as the lightning components version of the visualforce standard controller .
while this statement is an over - simplification , it serves to illustrate a point .
whenever possible , your components should use lightning data service to read and modify salesforce data .
data access with lightning data service is usually simpler than the equivalent using a server - side apex controller .
read - only access can be entirely declarative in your component ’s markup .
for code that modifies data , your component ’s javascript controller is roughly the same amount of code , and you eliminate the apex entirely .
additionally , all of your data access code is consolidated into your component , which significantly reduces complexity .
446 salesforce winter release notes lightning components : actions , events , styles , and security lightning data service provides other benefits aside from the code .
it ’s built on highly efficient local storage that ’s shared across all components that use it .
records loaded in lightning data service are cached and shared across components .
components accessing the same record see significant performance improvements , because a record is only loaded once , no matter how many components are using it .
shared records also improve user interface consistency .
when one component updates a record , any other components using it are notified , and in most cases refresh automatically .
see also : lightning components developer guide : lightning data service ( developer preview ) enable lightning components for custom actions add the force : lightningquickaction  or force : lightningquickactionwithoutheader  interface to a lightning component to enable it to be used as a custom action in lightning experience or salesforce1 .
you can use components that implement one of these interfaces as object - specific actions in both lightning experience and salesforce1 .
you can use them as global actions only in salesforce1 .
when used as actions , components that implement the force : lightningquickaction  interface display in a panel with standard action controls , such as a cancel button .
these components can also display and implement their own controls , but should be prepared for events from the standard controls .
components that implement the force : lightningquickactionwithoutheader  interface display in a panel without additional controls and are expected to provide a complete user interface for the action .

launch a lightning component from an action lightning components developer guide : configure components for custom actions access check violations
are now enforced access check enforcement was a critical update in summer ’16 and will be enforced for all orgs sometime between october 15 and october 19 , 2016 .
improved access check enforcement for lightning resources enables component authors to have greater control over how their components are used .
you can control access to lightning resources via the access  system attribute on these tags : • < aura : application > 447 salesforce winter release notes lightning components : actions , events , styles , and security •
< aura : attribute > •
< aura : component > •
< aura : event > •
< aura : interface > •
< aura : method > the default value for lightning resources is access="public " , which makes the resources available only within the same namespace .
this sample component has global access .
< aura : component access="global " > ...
< /aura : component > access violations if your code accesses a resource , such as a component or attribute , that does n’t have an access  system attribute allowing you to access it , the code does n’t execute or returns undefined .
if you enabled debug mode , you also see a popup error message .
anatomy of an access check error message here is a sample access check error message for an access violation .
access check failed ! componentservice.getdef():'markup://c : targetcomponent ' is not visible to ' markup://c : sourcecomponent ' .
an error message has four parts : 1 .
the context ( who is trying to access the resource ) .
in our example , this is markup://c : sourcecomponent . 2 .
the target ( the resource being accessed ) .
in our example , this is markup://c : targetcomponent . 3 .
the type of failure .
in our example , this is not visible . 4 .
the code that triggered the failure .
this is usually a class method .
in our example , this is componentservice.getdef ( ) , which means that the target definition ( component ) was not accessible .
a definition describes metadata for a resource , such as a component .
fixing access check errors tip :  if your code is n’t working as you expect , enable debug mode to get better error reporting .
you can fix access check errors using one or more of these techniques . •
add appropriate access  system attributes to the resources that you own .
• remove references in your code to resources that are n’t available .
in the earlier example , markup://c : targetcomponent does n’t have an access value allowing markup://c : sourcecomponent  to access it . •
ensure that an attribute that you ’re accessing exists by looking at its < aura : attribute >  definition .
confirm that you ’re using the correct case - sensitive spelling for the name . accessing an undefined attribute or an attribute that is out of scope , for example a private attribute ,
triggers the same access violation message .
the access context does n’t know whether the attribute is undefined or inaccessible .
for more information about the access  system attribute , see the lightning components developer guide .

capture events before they bubble up and away the lightning component framework supports a new capture phase for component and application events .
previously , the framework only supported a bubble phase for component events .
the framework now also supports the bubble phase for application events .
these phases are similar to dom handling patterns and provide an opportunity for interested components to interact with an event and potentially control the behavior for subsequent handlers .
the component that fires an event is known as the source component .
the framework allows you to handle the event in different phases .
these phases give you flexibility for how to best process the event for your application .
the phases are : capture the event is captured and trickles down from the application root to the source component .
the event can be handled by a component in the containment hierarchy that receives the captured event .
event handlers are invoked in order from the application root down to the source component that fired the event .
any registered handler in this phase can stop the event from propagating , at which point no more handlers are called in this phase or the bubble phase .
bubble the component that fired the event can handle it .
the event then bubbles up from the source component to the application root .
the event can be handled by a component in the containment hierarchy that receives the bubbled event .
event handlers are invoked in order from the source component that fired the event up to the application root .
any registered handler in this phase can stop the event from propagating , at which point no more handlers are called in this phase .
here ’s the sequence of component event propagation . 1
. event fired — a component event is fired . 2 .
capture phase —
the framework executes the capture phase from the application root to the source component until all components are traversed .
any handling event can stop propagation by calling stoppropagation ( )  on the event .
3 .
bubble phase —
the framework executes the bubble phase from the source component to the application root until all components are traversed or stoppropagation ( )  is called .
note :  application events have a separate default phase that ’s executed after the bubble phase .
the default phase preserves the framework ’s original handling behavior for application events .
the < aura : handler >  tag has a new phase  attribute to set the phase of event handling .
if you do n’t set a phase  value , the default phase is bubble  for component events , and default  for application events .
here is an example of a handler for the capture phase for an application event .
< aura : handler event="c : appevent " action="{!c.handlecapturedevent } " phase="capture " / > 450 salesforce winter release notes lightning components : actions , events , styles , and security for more information , see the lightning components developer guide .

handle bubbled events in container components lightning components developer guide : communicating with events handle bubbled events in container components some components contain other components but are n’t the owner of those components .
these components are known as container components .
you can now handle captured or bubbled events in container components .
this feature paves the way for wrapper components that provide event handling behavior around their dynamic content , enabling new patterns for component design , composition , and reuse .
default event propagation rules by default , every parent in the containment hierarchy ca n’t handle an event during the capture and bubble phases .
instead , the event propagates to every owner in the containment hierarchy .
a component ’s owner is the component that is responsible for its creation .
for declaratively created components , the owner is the outermost component containing the markup that references the component firing the event .
for programmatically created components , the owner component is the component that invoked $ a.createcomponent  to create it .
the same rules apply for the capture phase , although the direction of event propagation ( down ) is the opposite of the bubble phase ( up ) .
confused ?
it makes more sense when you look at an example in the bubbling phase .
c : owner  contains c : container , which in turn contains c : eventsource .
< !
--c : owner-- > < aura : component > < c : container > < c : eventsource / > < /c : container > <
/aura : component > if c : eventsource  fires an event , it can handle the event itself .
the event then bubbles up the containment hierarchy .
c : container  contains c : eventsource  but it ’s not the owner because it ’s not the outermost component in the markup , so it ca n’t handle the bubbled event .
c : owner  is the owner because c : container  is in its markup .
c : owner  can handle the event .
propagation to all container components the default behavior does n’t allow an event to be handled by every parent in the containment hierarchy .
some components contain other components but are n’t the owner of those components .
these components are known as container components .
in the example , c : container  is a container component because it ’s not the owner for c : eventsource .
by default , c : container  ca n’t handle events fired by c : eventsource .
a container component has a facet attribute whose type is aura .
component [ ] , such as the default body  attribute .
the container component includes those components in its definition using an expression , such as { !
v.body}. the container component is n’t the owner of the components rendered with that expression .
451 salesforce winter release notes lightning components : actions , events , styles , and security to allow a container component to handle the event , add includefacets="true "  to the < aura : handler >  tag of the container component .
for example , adding includefacets="true " to the handler in the container component , c : container , enables it to handle the component event bubbled from c : eventsource .
< aura : handler name="bubblingevent " event="c : compevent " action="{!c.handlebubbling } " includefacets="true " / > see also : capture events before they bubble up and away lightning components developer guide : communicating with events events from dynamically created components propagate properly before winter , if you created a component programmatically using $ a.createcomponent ( ) , events did n’t propagate to the component ’s containment hierarchy .
this bug meant that there was a difference in event propagation behavior depending on whether the event was fired in a component created in markup versus code .
in winter , we fixed event propagation behavior so that components created programmatically in code behave the same way as components created declaratively in markup .
if you wrote code to work around the issue with event propagation in dynamically created components , make sure that you do n’t have duplicate event handlers now .
for example , you no longer need to use cmp.addhandler ( )  to wire up a handler to work around the limitation for dynamically created components .
use the lightning design system in lightning apps use the lightning design system to style your lightning apps by extending force : slds  or using a static resource .
the salesforce lightning design system provides a look and feel that ’s consistent with lightning experience .
use lightning design system styles to give your custom applications a ui that is consistent with salesforce , without having to reverse - engineer our styles .
your application automatically gets lightning design system styles and design tokens if it extends force : slds .
this method is the easiest way to stay up to date and consistent with lightning design system enhancements .
to extend force : slds :
< aura : application extends="force : slds " > < ! -- customize your application here -- > < /aura : application >
when you extend force : slds , the version of lightning design system styles are automatically updated whenever the css changes .
if you want to use a specific lightning design system version , download the version and add it to your org as a static resource .
note :  we recommend extending force : slds instead so that you automatically get the latest lightning design system styles .
if you stick to a specific lightning design system version , your app ’s styles will gradually start to drift from later versions in lightning experience or incur the cost of duplicate css downloads .

this section : clickjack protection improvements for visualforce pages without page header
in this release we ’ve improved clickjack protection for visualforce pages that have their headers disabled by setting showheader="false "  on the < apex : page >  tag .
clickjack protection for legacy browsers for visualforce pages without page header ( critical update )
this critical update extends legacy browser - compatible clickjack protection for visualforce pages that set showheader="false " when those pages are also configured to use api versions before 27.0 .
pagereference getcontent ( ) and getcontentaspdf ( ) methods now behave as callouts ( critical update ) this critical update was introduced in summer ’15 and was enforced for all orgs on october 18 , 2016 .
clickjack protection improvements for visualforce pages without page header
in this release we ’ve improved clickjack protection for visualforce pages that have their headers disabled by setting showheader="false "  on the < apex : page >  tag .
in certain circumstances , even if you had enabled the enable clickjack protection for customer visualforce pages with headers disabled setting , a bug could prevent clickjack protection from fully working .
458 salesforce winter release notes visualforce : enhanced for lightning experience we ’ve resolved the bug , but some pages might depend on the old behavior .
to preserve compatibility for these pages , this change is versioned .
you must update pages to api 38.0 or later to take advantage of the fix .
until you do so , pages with showheader  set to false  have reduced protection against clickjacking .
the pages most likely to have problems are those that add a static < head >  block themselves , but do n’t use the applyhtmltag and applybodytag  attributes of the < apex : page >  tag to take full control of the page ’s html structure .
we recommend that , if you ’re adding a static < head > element to a page , take full control and add static < html >  and < body >  elements yourself , too .
and , if you do this , remember to set the page ’s applyhtmltag  and applybodytag  attributes to false !
clickjack protection for legacy browsers for visualforce pages without page header ( critical update ) this critical update extends legacy browser - compatible clickjack protection for visualforce pages that set showheader="false " when those pages are also configured to use api versions before 27.0 .
several security settings add clickjack protection to visualforce pages .
two of these settings are affected by this critical update .
the “ enable clickjack protection for customer visualforce pages with headers disabled ” setting , found in security > session settings in setup , enables clickjack protection on an org ’s visualforce pages that set the page ’s showheader  attribute to false .
the “
clickjack protection level ” setting , found in develop > sites in setup , enables clickjack protection for visualforce pages displayed in force.com sites .
modern browsers are protected from clickjack attacks by setting the x - frame - options http header .
legacy browsers , such as older versions of internet explorer , do n’t respect this header .
to enable clickjack protection for these older browsers , some html markup and javascript code are added to the page itself .
however , when rendered without the standard salesforce page header ( by setting the page ’s showheader  attribute to false ) , visualforce pages set to api versions 26.0 or earlier did n’t include the html markup and javascript code necessary to embed the clickjack protection scripts for legacy browsers .
legacy browser clickjack protection was omitted even when the org or site was configured to include that protection .
with this update enabled , visualforce ensures that , when necessary , the expected markup and code are added to the page regardless of the page ’s api setting .
this update allows all visualforce pages to respect the org or site ’s clickjack protection settings .
this critical update has no effect on pages that set the page ’s contenttype  attribute to any value besides “ text / html ” or “ text / xhtml ” .
test this critical update we recommend that you test this update in a sandbox or developer edition org to verify correct behavior of your visualforce pages before enabling it in your production org .
if you must work in your production org , do so during off - peak hours .
to activate this critical update : 1 .
from setup , enter critical updates  in the quick find  box , and then select critical updates .
2 . click activate for “ clickjack protection for legacy browsers for visualforce pages without page header ” .
3 . test any visualforce pages you have that are set to api version 26.0 or earlier and that have the showheader  attribute set to false .
the pages most likely to have problems are those that add a static < head >  block themselves , but do n’t use the applyhtmltag and applybodytag  attributes of the < apex : page >  tag to take full control of the page ’s html structure .
we recommend that , if you ’re adding a static < head > element to a page , take full control and add static < html >  and < body >  elements yourself , too .
and , if you do this , remember to set the page ’s applyhtmltag  and applybodytag  attributes to false ! 459
salesforce winter release notes lightning design system pagereference getcontent ( ) and getcontentaspdf ( ) methods now behave as callouts ( critical update ) this critical update was introduced in summer ’15 and was enforced for all orgs on october 18 , 2016 .
the getcontent ( )  and getcontentaspdf ( )  methods return the content of a rendered visualforce page as html and pdf , respectively .
with this critical update , the getcontent ( )  and getcontentaspdf ( )  methods of the pagereference object behave as callouts , and the calls are tracked against the limits of the calling transaction .

the daily batch limit has been increased to 10,000 for all orgs .
messaging messaging includes a pilot feature , platform events .
deliver customizable events with platform events ( beta ) use platform events to deliver secure and scalable custom notifications within salesforce or from external sources .
define fields to customize your platform event .
your custom platform event determines the event data that the force.com platform can produce or consume .
this feature is available in both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
you can define platform events in salesforce classic only .
note :  this release contains a beta version of platform events , which means it ’s a high - quality feature with known limitations .
for information on enabling this feature in your org , contact salesforce .
platform events is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
we ca n’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all .
make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available products and features .
you can provide feedback and suggestions for platform events in the success community .
editions available in : performance , unlimited , enterprise , and developer editions
by using platform events , publishers can send customized event data through apex or an api .
subscribers can receive custom notifications from salesforce or an external system and respond with actions using apex or cometd clients .
for example , a printer can make an api call to publish an event when the ink is low .
the custom printer event can contain custom fields for the printer model , serial number , and ink level .
the event is processed in salesforce by an apex trigger that places an order for a new cartridge .
platform events simplify the process of communicating changes and responding to them without writing complex logic .
publishers and subscribers communicate with each other through events .
multiple subscribers can listen to the same event and carry out different actions .
define your platform event define your platform event in the platform events page in the salesforce user interface .
from setup , enter platform events  in the quick find  box , then select platform events .
platform events are sobjects , similar to custom objects but with some limitations .
event notifications are instances of platform events .
unlike sobjects , you ca n’t update event notifications .
you also ca n’t view them in the user interface .
when you delete platform event definitions , they ’re permanently deleted .
publish and subscribe to platform events after you define your platform event , you can publish event notifications and subscribe to events using apex or an api .
in apex , you publish event notifications by inserting event records with the eventbus.publish  static method .
to receive published notifications , write an after insert  trigger on your event object .
in the trigger , you can inspect each event notification and perform some business logic .
you do n’t need to create a channel , because salesforce creates a channel for each defined platform event .
using an api , you publish events by creating records of your event in the same way that you insert sobjects .
you can use any salesforce api to create platform events , such as soap api , rest api , or bulk api .
unlike apex , there is no extra call to publish the event .
subscribe to events with cometd clients or by writing apex after insert  triggers on your event object .
482 salesforce winter release notes api example :  publish an event with apex in apex , use the eventbus.publish  method to publish one or more events .
the event api name is the name of the event appended with the _ _
e  suffix .
in this example , the event name is low ink , and the event api name used in apex is low_ink__e .
this example creates two low_ink__e  events and inserts them using the eventbus.publish  method .
list
< low_ink__e > inkevents = new list < low_ink__e > ( ) ; inkevents.add(new low_ink__e(printer_model__c='xzo-5 ' , serial_number__c='12345 ' , ink_percentage__c=0.2 ) ) ; inkevents.add(new low_ink__e(printer_model__c='mn-123 ' , serial_number__c='10013 ' , ink_percentage__c=0.15 ) ) ; // call method to publish events list < database .
saveresult > results = eventbus.publish(inkevents ) ; example :  subscribe to an event with apex this example is a trigger on the low_ink__e  event .
the trigger is fired when low ink notifications are received .
the trigger iterates through each event , and based on the printer model , creates a case .
finally , the trigger inserts all generated cases .
trigger lowinktrigger on low_ink__e ( after insert ) { //
trigger for catching low_ink events . //
iterate through each notification . //
list to hold all cases to be created .
list < case > cases = new list < case > ( ) ; for ( low_ink__e event : trigger .
new ) { system.debug('printer model : ' + event .
printer_model__c ) ; if ( event .
printer_model__c = = ' mn-123 ' ) { //
create case to order new printer cartridge .
case cs = new case ( ) ; cs .
priority = ' medium ' ; cs .
subject = ' order new ink cartridge for sn ' + event .
serial_number__c ; cases.add(cs ) ; } } //
insert all cases corresponding to events received .
insert cases ; } see also : platform events ( beta ) tooling api tooling api includes new and changed objects , calls , and resources .
