for example , show the average probability and number of opportunities by stage .

other people to reports you subscribed to the opportunity overview report and receive the report by email each morning .

consider that they may see more or less data than they normally see in salesforce .
create report and dashboard folders in lightning experience folders are key to sharing and organizing reports and dashboards .

82 salesforce summer release notes lightning experience features in this release chatter use topics to organize your content in chatter you most definitely asked , and we most definitely answered by introducing topics in lightning experience .
no need to set up anything , as our lightning experience org is automatically updated to support topics .
discover people to follow and groups to join personalized einstein recommendations on the chatter home page help you find the people and groups that most closely relate to your job and interests .
the more recommendations you accept , the more relevant your feed becomes .
there are lots of shiny new features for streams streams have a new home page , new actions and filters , and a higher limit .
create up to 100 streams .
your chatter home lists the five you most recently viewed .
set the frequency of notifications for stream activity when you create a stream or from the stream itself .
use a record ’s follow action to add it to a stream when you create a stream , the follow button that appears on profile and record detail pages changes .
a plus sign is added to it .
it indicates that you can use the follow button not only to follow , but also to add that person or record to a stream .
you can also add them to a stream that you create on the spot .
groups get a new follow in stream action for adding the group feed to an existing stream .
get a richer experience with the new editor in chatter we updated the editor in the chatter publisher for faster performance and compatibility with locker service .
but they ’re not the only benefits .
we improved mentions .
when you start to mention someone , the selection list opens right where your cursor is instead of at the bottom of the publisher .
and topics gets the same treatment ( yes ! topics in lightning experience ! ) .
sort feed global search results by relevance chatter results have a new sorting option when you do a global search : top posts .
top posts are the most relevant posts based on your search query .
company highlights is the default feed for new users the default feed on the chatter home page is shown when a user navigates to the page , returns to it , or refreshes the chatter home .
up to now , the default for everyone was the what i follow feed .
from now on , if someone is following fewer than 10 things , the company highlights feed becomes their default .
new users now have a chance to see what ’s most active in their org and to get ideas about more things to follow .
when a user follows more than 10 things , the default feed changes to what i follow .
filter groups to show unread posts groups have a new feed filter , unread posts , to get you to unread content quickly .
to see this filter , you must be a member of the group .
what ’s considered read ?
posts you ’ve liked , commented on , edited , scrolled through , or viewed in detail .
filter a profile to see a user ’s posts when you visit someone ’s profile , you can filter their profile feed to show just the posts that they added .
you can filter your own profile , too .
select the posts by this user filter to show only posts from the user whose profile you ’re visiting , including when you visit your own .
it ’s a quick way to get to the information you ’re most interested in .
the what i follow feed gets some new filters we added a little volume control to your what i follow feed .
use the all updates and fewer updates filters to include or omit feed tracked changes in your feed .
is your post reaching the right people ?
posts in private and unlisted chatter groups have a seen - by count that shows the number of people who have seen a post .
click the count to see the names of the people .
share a post with a group in lightning experience in lightning experience , besides sharing a chatter post with your followers , you can also share it with a group .
click the share link next to like and comment to see the new share with group option .
select share with group , and search in the share dialog for the group you ’re interested in .
83 salesforce summer release notes lightning experience features in this release create a report on the top 100 feed item views here ’s another opportunity to get great insight into current trends in your company .
a new primary object , interaction count reports , is available for creating custom reports on the top 100 feed item views in your organization or community .
encryption for chatter gets updates ( pilot ) the encryption for chatter pilot continues to protect sensitive information in your chatter feed .
we added link urls and poll choices to the body of encrypted content .
encryption for chatter is n’t ready for production , but you can safely try it out in a dedicated sandbox environment .
manage members with ease in the spirit of consolidation and streamlining , we improved member management .
no longer do you need to go to multiple places to take care of member business .
add or remove members right from manage members , or change them from member to manager ( or back)—kind of like one - stop shopping but easier .
see group email notifications on the group page the type of email notifications you are currently receiving for a group display on a button next to the group image .
not getting enough notifications ?
getting too many ?
click it and change the setting .
get group info ( and even join ) in the tile view you know how you can switch the groups list view so that groups display as tiles ?
we thought tiles were so much fun that we decided to make them even more useful .
now you can see how many members are in a group , what type of group it is , when the last activity took place , who owns it , if you are a member , and even join or leave the group right from the tile .
identify external users at a glance sometimes you want to know a bit more about chatter users , like if they are part of your org or not .
to make that easier , we added an orange border and the word external to the user ’s profile photo if the user is not part of your org .
communities easily switch between your salesforce org and communities this functionality is available in communities based on customer service ( napili ) , partner central , and any lightning bolt solutions .
files updates to libraries folders in libraries are now generally available , and we ’ve made some updates to improve your experience using files and folders in libraries .
you can now add multiple files to a library , update and delete library files , and move folders within a library .
customize the files detail page make files work better for you by customizing the fields and layout of the files detail page .
choose from standard fields to show when the file was last updated , file size , file type , and more .
create custom fields and buttons to track metadata specific to your business , to use in validation rules , and provide data for searches and reports .
validation rules improve file data
to ensure the quality of the information in your libraries , create validation rules for files added to libraries , records , and files home , such as requiring users to follow naming conventions or fill in mandatory fields .
combine validation rules with customized file detail pages and record types to turbocharge the quality of the file data in your org .
share public links to your files sharing your files just got even easier .
create a public link to a file , then distribute the url to anyone you want .
public link sharing was already available in salesforce classic and lightning email .
now it ’s available as a files action in lightning experience and communities .
84 salesforce summer release notes lightning experience features in this release get better performing , more secure content previews with lightning delivery player when someone shares a file with you via a public link , you open a preview of that file in the lightning delivery player .
the new lightning delivery player runs on html5 instead of flash , improving security .
the images are based on vector graphics , which provide higher quality renditions and better performance as they load page by page .
the lightning delivery player retains the ability to protect content deliveries with a password and delivery expiration , so content is seen by the right recipients at the right time .
unshare a file you can now remove sharing settings on a file from a library or record .
because sometimes when you giveth , you later need to taketh away .
right - click to open a file in a new tab
sometimes it ’s the littlest changes that make the biggest impact in your daily work .
right - click a file to open it in a new tab .
now you can open multiple files at once and work on them in the order you choose .
drag files onto files and attachments related lists we made adding files to records super easy .
just drag them onto a files or attachments related list for any object .
you can also click the upload files button to add files .
you get this new functionality automatically— there ’s nothing to enable .
take action on files right from the feed access the most important file actions directly from the feed .
you no longer have to open the file preview to copy a link or share or download a file — you can do it right from chatter .
authenticate effortlessly to external file sources in salesforce does your org have external file sources like google drive enabled ?
if you ’re not logged in , click the banner notification to sign in with one click .
when you post a link to a google drive document in a feed post when you ’re not logged in , a prompt displays immediately after you post .
these prompts get you authenticated quickly right where you are so you can get on with your work .
enjoy more room for files you ’re moving away from documents and attachments in favor of salesforce files .
image and video files are more popular ( and bigger ) than ever .
and salesforce files get more versatile and more shareable all the time .
you need more room for files , and we ’re giving you more .
so go ahead and add files , convert attachments , and make updates to the files you already have without fear of hitting limits .
lightning app builder power up your lightning pages with the flow component ( generally available ) welcome a new component to the lightning app builder .
use the flow component to embed active flows in your lightning page . personalize home and record pages with einstein recommendations add the new recommendations component so that your users can see relevant people to follow and groups to join .
add a launch pad for all your third - party apps on your home pages we added an app launcher component to the lightning app builder .
now you can make all your third - party apps available from the first page that your users see .
with a home page , you can combine various components on a single page to present key information to your user in one place .
but until now , you could n’t add any third - party apps to home pages .
by adding an app launcher component to the home page , users can access all their third - party apps and items in a single click .
salesforce connect improved support for picklist and multi - select picklist fields on external objects with the cross - org adapter for salesforce connect , your users can interact with picklist and multi - select picklist fields on external objects just as they do with custom objects .
syncing no longer converts multi - select picklist fields on the provider org into text fields on the subscriber org ’s external objects .
we now support picklist fields that use a global picklist value set on the provider org . 85 salesforce summer release notes lightning experience features in this release new rate limit applied to external object search results external data rows that are retrieved as search results now count toward a separate and much higher rate limit from rows retrieved by other means .
so good news : your org is unlikely to exceed rate limits when searching , reading , or writing to external objects .
prepare for temporary salesforce ids for external object records in a near future release , temporary salesforce record ids will be assigned to external object records that are retrieved by sosl and salesforce searches , rather than permanent ids .
to prepare for this change , do n’t create code or use third - party integrations that require these record ids to remain associated with the same external data rows .
for existing code and integrations , we recommend removing dependencies on external object record ids to avoid issues when this change is rolled out .
business logic & process automation approvals reassign approval requests if you receive an approval request that someone else should approve , you can now reassign it to the person from any salesforce experience .
previously , you could reassign approval requests only in salesforce classic .
recall submitted approval requests if you want to pull back an approval request that you submitted , you can now recall it from any salesforce experience .

you can now add flows to any lightning page .
launch flows in lightning runtime from buttons , links , and custom tabs lightning flow runtime now plays nicer with custom buttons , custom links , and web tabs .
say goodbye to blank screens and tabs where you were expecting a flow to render .
redirect flows that render in lightning runtime the url parameter returl  lets you control what happens when a flow interview finishes .
lightning runtime now respects the url parameter returl .
previously , only the classic runtime respected the parameter .
now you see me , now you do n’t : dynamically update flow screen fields ( pilot ) the fewer times your users have to click next , the better . if you agree , keep reading !
use field rules to control when to show or hide particular screen fields .
turn your flows into guided uis that respond to users’ inputs and selections .
save your users time by showing only what they need when they need it .
access encrypted data in your flows ( beta ) flows now support encrypted fields , except in filters and sorting .
get extended error details for flows in the tooling api do you use the force.com tooling api to build flows ?
in most places , we replaced the dreaded unknown_exception error code with flow_exception .
and we added extended error details to most flow errors .
that way , you can craft the right error message for your client . customize the look and feel of flow interviews with the rest api ( pilot ) we ’re continuing to pilot rest api resources that give you full access to flows and their interviews .
use the rest api to build your own flow runtime experience .
86 salesforce summer release notes lightning experience features in this release process builder access encrypted data in process builder ( beta ) process builder now supports encrypted fields , except in filters in the update records action .
stop automated field updates from suppressing email notifications ( critical update )
for various operations , such as assigning a task to someone , you can choose to notify the affected user by email .
this update stops processes , workflow rules , and apex triggers from suppressing these email notifications .
setup block execution of javascript in the hyperlink function ( critical update )
previously , you could use javascript to prepare the url argument in a hyperlink function .
however , this approach introduces a security vulnerability because javascript can include cross - site scripting and make the url execute on behalf of users .
this critical update blocks the execution of javascript used to specify a url in the hyperlink function .
disable lookup record preview in lightning experience for accessibility when you ’re viewing a record in lightning experience , you can hover over links to related records to preview lookup record details .
for example , while viewing an opportunity , you can view the cases and other opportunities associated with the account by hovering over the account name .
you can disable this feature to ensure that lightning experience is accessible for visually impaired users employing screen readers .
to disable lookup record preview , contact salesforce support .
security and identity import a custom security baseline into health check ( generally available ) security health check custom baselines , which were beta in spring , are now released to all customers .
you can customize the health check security baseline to compare your org ’s security settings with your industry standards .
new wizard guides
you through creating policies the new lightning experience interface for transaction security incorporates a wizard for creating basic policies , a new way to look at policy views , and a carousel .
development ui api ( developer preview ) use ui api to create native mobile apps and custom web apps with your own branding and look and feel .
a single rest request returns enough metadata , layout information , and data to display , edit , or create a record .
send and manage orders in lightning experience the channel order app ( coa ) is now available in lightning experience .
we streamlined order submission so it ’s faster to send orders to salesforce for billing , activation , and provisioning .

in your csv file for import , add a header " recordtypeid " to specify the record type that you want to assign to each article . •
add only one record type for each article .

see also : more lightning service setup flows ( beta ) considerations for lightning knowledge lightning knowledge has some limitations .
consider the following as you decide whether to enable lightning knowledge .
this change applies to lightning experience only .
note :  currently , lightning knowledge is best for orgs new to knowledge or for existing orgs that only have one article type , have few data categories , and use single - language mode .
enabling lightning knowledge changes the data model of your org to use record types instead of article types .
orgs with multiple articles types require data migration to consolidate article types before they can enable lightning knowledge .
currently , no migration tools are available for this process .
important : once lightning knowledge is enabled , it ca n’t be disabled .
test in a sandbox or trial org before enabling in production . •
if you have multiple article types in classic knowledge , you ca n't enable lightning knowledge currently . •
lightning knowledge does n’t support multiple languages and translation .
if multi - language is enabled in your org , you can not enable lightning knowledge currently . •
we recommend using lightning knowledge only if you have fewer than 300 data categories .
if you have more , you can experience slower performance .

the show totals option for tables is now in a dedicated menu ( 3 ) .
choose charts from a unified menu remember when the charts you used for presenting visualizations in a dashboard were n't available for exploring data ?
with the new explorer , there 's a seamless data exploration and presentation experience .
explorer now uses wave charts , which means you get the same experience in explorer and wave dashboard designer .
all your favorite charts from explorer , such as calendar heat map and parallel coordinates , are now united with your favorite charts from dashboard designer , such as pyramid and waterfall .
drill into data with the push of a button a new drill - down button appears when you make selections on a chart . 248 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates

249 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates
other changes in explorer lenses clip from explorer to the wave dashboard designer with visual settings intact .
your carefully configured visualization appears the same in the dashboard designer as it did while you were exploring .
you can now view saql - form steps from a dashboard in read - only mode in explorer .
previously , you could only open steps in compact form .
to enable users to open a step in explorer , enable the show explore icon widget property .
if you access explorer from within a dashboard , you can reference multiple datasets in the saql for the step you are exploring .
the datasets must already be used in the dashboard by other steps .
the simplest way to achieve that is to add a step to your dashboard for every dataset you intend to use , then copy the load “ { alias } ”  in these steps to your target step ’s saql .
in saql steps , the parser now identifies grouped and non - grouped dimensions ( strings ) separately .
the grouped dimensions are included in your visualizations by default , but the string dimensions are not .
you can manually add the string dimensions into a visualization by editing the underlying saql .
copy , paste , and focus commands are no longer available in explorer .
access more wave charts and configure them in more ways more wave charts have been added , giving you an unprecedented choice in how to best visualize your data .
with more ways of configuring and fine - tuning charts , it ’s even easier to create beautiful and effective visualizations .
visualize data with new wave charts wave charts now include calendar heat map , horizontal and vertical dot plots , the familiar line chart , and parallel coordinates , all of which used to be available only in explorer .
geo map and the angular gauge ( available in reports and dashboards ) are newely available in wave .
calendar heat maps are useful for visualizing recurring discrete activities , such as closing accounts , over long periods of time .
in this chart , you can easily change the granularity of the time - based grouping , such as from month to week or day .
250 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates horizontal and vertical dot plots use the size and coloring of bubbles to visualize multiple dimensions and measures .
251 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates parallel coordinates is useful in displaying how data elements in a grouping stack up against each other using one to four measures .
geo maps allow you to visualize data that contains geographical coordinates ( latitude and longitude ) .
for example , in a u.s. map you can display airport data with bubbles centered on actual airport locations instead of just home states .
252 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates use the angular gauge chart to track progress along a single measure , such as how much revenue has been realized versus the target . 253 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates enhance charts with icons add character to your charts by adding faces , flags , or other images to the numbers they display .
254 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates all you need is a dataset with an ungrouped url dimension whose values are urls to the icon images .
for example , each row in the following dataset has a url that points to a flag image stored in your org : country , country_code , region , flag_img_url , accounts , value australia , aus , south pacific , https://myorg.content.force.com / file - asset / flagaustraliapng,1898,22930651 china , chn , east asia , https://myorg.content.force.com / file - asset / flagchinapng,2051,29754009 europe , eur , europe , https://myorg.content.force.com / file - asset / flageuropepng,4668,61238042 france , fra , europe , https://myorg.content.force.com / file - asset / flagfrancepng,2303,28746829 india , ind , asia , https://myorg.content.force.com / file - asset / flagindiapng,2721,32037499 italy , ita , europe , https://myorg.content.force.com / file - asset / flagitalypng,1722,26340986 japan , jpn , east asia , https://myorg.content.force.com / file - asset / flagjapanpng,2872,36916012 russian federation , rus , east europe , https://myorg.content.force.com / file - asset / flagrussiapng,1847,27387456 south africa , zaf , africa , https://myorg.content.force.com / file - asset / flagsouthafricapng,879,9794857 south korea , kor , east asia , https://myorg.content.force.com / file - asset / flagsouthkoreapng,1643,21934785 united states of america , usa , north america , https://myorg.content.force.com / file - asset / flagusapng,6527,87044191 you can import that dataset into wave , then query it in saql mode : the image urls are queried using some non - grouping saql function : first('flag_img_url ' ) as ' flag_img_url ' .
255 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates returning to chart mode , you can then add the icons and configure their properties using a simple set of chart properties right from wave .
get more out of donut charts large slices of donut charts now display their values .
256 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates what 's more , you can customize the center value .
normally , the center value reflects the value of selected slices .
with the new customizable center value , you decide what ’s shown in the donut chart ’s center .
257 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates change the range to zoom in custom domain lets you determine which portion of a chart to focus on .
for example , a bar chart can show you store sales .
to focus only on stores that performed above a certain sales total , set the low value for the custom domain to the minimum sales total required .
the updated bar chart shows only the bars with totals that fall in the new range .
258 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates select data by dragging the mouse pointer selecting data points is as easy as click and drag .
or , click individual data elements , and keep clicking to continue to select multiple elements .
go back to the default selection ( all selected ) by clicking outside the chart on any white space in the chart .
259 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates other updates to wave charts you can adjust the bubble size on scatter charts and maps that use bubbles .
charts that use bubbles , such as dot plots and bubble map , now have a legend that correlates value to bubble size .
flat and polar gauges have tooltips and can be selected in a trellis display .
260 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates run your dashboards faster with the dashboard inspector the dashboard inspector shows how fast wave executes each step , allowing you to identify query bottlenecks to make them run faster .
it also shows how wave modifies step queries based on global filters , faceting , and bindings .
because dashboard layouts can contain different widgets ( and steps ) , run the inspector on each layout .
to open the dashboard inspector , preview the dashboard while browsing the app , select the right layout , and then click dashboard inspector .
261 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates note :  the dashboard inspector is n’t available while running the app or previewing an embedded dashboard outside of wave .
the dashboard inspector provides the following information .
query metrics use the query metrics to determine which step queries are taking the longest time to run .
if needed , tune the step queries to increase dashboard performance .
the inspector shows the following metrics for every step included in the dashboard layout .
metric # runs first ( ms ) avg ( ms ) description number of times wave executed the step query .
number of milliseconds that wave took to execute the step query for the first time .
average number of milliseconds that wave took to execute the query .
for tips about tuning saql queries , see query performance .
262 salesforce summer release notes step details wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates to view the details , select a step in the inspector .
the step details summarize different parts of the query , like measures , filters , groupings , and the dataset on which its built .
use the metrics in the last run metrics section to identify other events that contribute to the total time required to populate the results of a step .
metric metadata waiting query executed query description number of milliseconds that wave took to retrieve the extended metadata .
number of milliseconds that wave took to resolve bindings .

if you have questions about why a step does n’t show all expected results or behaves in an unexpected manner , click .
263 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates the query details page allows you to compare the query defined in your dashboard against the actual query executed when the dashboard is viewed .
you can see what additional filters are applied due to faceting and global filters , and the resolved values of bindings , if applicable .
if bindings are used in the query , the bindings tracer provides a step - by - step breakdown of each bindings function and the resolved value .
the bindings tracer allows you to see if the resulting data — including both content and format — is what you intended .
tailor the results to the user viewing the dashboard you can modify a step query based on the logged - in user .
for example , you can filter opportunity records and show only those opportunities owned by this user .
previously , you could only apply user tokens to the start value .
you can specify user tokens in any query parameter in saql , soql , and aggregateflex  step types .
to specify a token , use the following syntax : ! { user.<user object field name>}. valid tokens are : user .
id , user.name , user.roleid , and user.rolename .
the following saql - type step uses the user .
id  token as a query filter so that opportunity owners viewing the dashboard can only see their opportunities .
" my_opportunities_1 " : { " type " : " saql " , " query " : " q = load " geoopp";q = filter q by ' ownerid ' = = \"!{user .

264 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates note :  the show totals field appears in the widget properties only if the show totals option is enabled in the step .
while creating the step in table mode , select options > show totals .
you can set the table column size to the following .
fit to data dynamically set the column widths based on the length of the data .
you can also set a minimum and maximum width to ensure that the column is n’t too wide or narrow .
265 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates fixed width set each column to the same width .
fit to widget fit the columns to the size of the widget .

and now , with new tools such as connectors and the dataflow editor , it ’s more important than ever that you can quickly find what you need .
so we reorganized the data manager and renamed tabs to make it easier to find your way around .
open the data manager in wave from the gear icon .
270 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates the monitor tab is probably the one you visit most often , to check the progress of your data jobs and dataflows .
so we left it unchanged at the top as your landing tab .
if you ’ve enabled replication , we ’ve moved the create button from dataflow view to the new dataflows & recipes tab .
dataflows and recipes are your two key data preparation tools , so it makes sense to put them together on the same tab : dataflows & recipes .
on the dataflows & recipes tab , each tool has its own subtab ( 1 ) .
the dataflows subtab brings dataflow management to the surface ; no more digging deep into the monitor tab to do it .
all your usual dataflow tasks are accessible here , through the actions button ( 2 ) .
so make this is your new go - to place for creating , editing , scheduling , and running dataflows .
and , just a click away , continue your data preparation on the dataset recipes subtab , where you can create , edit , and keep track of all your recipes .
datasets have been given what they deserve : a tab of their own .
271 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates if you have replication enabled , there ’s a replicated data subtab here too ( 1 ) .
datasets and replicated data are your starting points for new recipes , so having them all in one place makes it easier to just grab one and go .
start a recipe in just two clicks through the actions button ( 2 ) , from any dataset or replicated data you see on these tabs .
if you ’ve enabled replication in your org , the setup tab is the new home for all things replication .
go here to set up and run replication and create connections using the new wave connectors .
connect to external data with clicks , not code ( generally available ) wave connectors give you an easy way to connect to data inside and outside of your salesforce org and bring it into wave .
quickly connect to data in your local org , another salesforce org , or marketing cloud .
or connect to popular web - based services : amazon redshift and heroku postgres .
and did we mention : no code required .
connectors were introduced as a pilot feature in the spring ` 17 release , but are now generally available and already turned on for you if you have replication enabled .
think of a wave connector as a cable , with different types of cables available to connect to different data sources .
you can connect to a new data source and bring in data with just a few steps .
1 . choose a connector for your data source .
272 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates 2 .
create a connection to the data source by providing login details and other settings .
3 .
when you ’re connected to the data source , select the table or object you want to bring into wave and the associated fields .
4 .
run replication .
the data comes into wave as a replicated object .
note :  you can reuse a connection to bring in data from other tables or objects in the same data source .
after the data is replicated , you can use it in dataflows and recipes to create or update datasets .
what types of connectors
can i use ?
five types of connectors are available : one for bringing in data from your local org , and four for external data .
let ’s look at how an example company , blue sky solar , uses each connector .
blue sky solar sells and installs solar panels in california and arizona .
salesforce local connector big sky solar already uses replication to bring its california sales data into wave .
the company uses the salesforce local connector to replicate additional objects without having to add them to the dataflow .
salesforce external connector to qualify for state issued grants , the company operates as separate entities in arizona and california .
each entity operates its own salesforce org .
senior leadership wants to understand the state of the business across both entities .
the company uses the salesforce external connector to connect the california org wave instance to the arizona org opportunity data .
this data is then merged with the california salesforce org opportunity data in wave to create a unified view of the opportunity pipeline .
273 salesforce summer release notes marketing cloud connector wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates blue sky solar tracks prospects in marketing cloud .
the company plans to enter the southern california market and wants to launch a personalized marketing campaign .
the wave marketing cloud connector allows the marketing team to load prospect data from previous campaigns into wave and use wave dashboards to target select companies and households .
heroku postgres connector prospect customers interested in installing a solar system can download the blue sky solar mobile app .
the app helps the prospect identify suitable rooftop spaces for a solar system .
this data is stored in a heroku postgres database , and the marketing team uses it for targeted campaigns .
the wave heroku postgres connector lets the team to move this data into wave for analysis .
amazon redshift connector
each installed solar system constantly monitors the generated electricity .
blue sky solar has a salesforce community page that provides an account overview for each customer , using wave - driven widgets to show the generated electricity .
the raw data is initially stored in amazon redshift , from where aggregated views are created and brought into wave using the amazon redshift connector .
i ’m ready to connect .
how do i turn on connectors ?
wave connectors are enabled when you enable replication .
if you haven’t enabled replication , you can do it from setup .
enter wave analytics in the quick find box , then click settings .
select enable replication , and then click save .
important :  there are a few things to consider before you enable replication .
we recommend that you read understand what happens when you enable replication first .
with replication enabled , head to the data manager in wave .
you create and manage connections on the setup tab , along with your existing replicated data .
274 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates the setup tab displays all your replicated data in one place , organized by connection type .
local salesforce objects ( 1 ) replicated through the dataflow or the salesforce local connector appear first .
external replicated objects appear by connection type below ( 2 ) .
click set
up replication ( 3 ) to create , edit , or delete connections , or create replications .
imagine you are the wave admin at blue sky solar .
let ’s walk through connecting to the company ’s remote arizona org , and selecting data to bring into wave .
your first step is to create the connection .
create a connection to create a connection , click set up replication .
a salesforce local connection is already set up , ready for you to connect to objects in your local org .
other connections that you create appear here , too .
275 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates click add remote connection .
the available connectors appear .
click the connector you need , and enter the connection settings for that connection .
for blue sky solar , you select the salesforce multi - org connector to connect to the remote arizona org .
all connections require a name , developer name , and description .
the remaining settings differ depending on the connector you choose .
see create a remote connection to learn more about each connector ’s settings .
276 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates when you save the connection settings , the new connection appears on the select connection page , ready for use .
use a connection to replicate an object
now you can start using your new connection to bring data into wave .
for blue sky solar , you want to bring in account , opportunity , and user data from the arizona org , so click the arizona sales connection .
you start with accounts , so , from the list of available objects , select account .
continue on to select the fields from this object .
select object select fields 277 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates select object select fields after selecting fields , you get the chance to preview the data you ’re replicating before you save .
when you save , the selected object appears on the setup tab of the data manager with other objects using the same connector .
repeat this process for other objects you want to replicate .
important :  you must run replication before new replicated objects are available for use in dataflows and recipes .
note :  each time you run replication , all data in an external replicated object is refreshed .
incremental refreshes and filtering are not available for external connections .
use replicated objects in dataflows and recipes after replication has run , you can prepare your replicated data in dataflows and recipes .
for dataflows , use the new digest transformation to extract data from the replicated object .
if you ’re using the new dataflow editor , look for the digest node button ( working in json , add a digest node to your dataflow definition file . )
.
if you ’re to prepare replicated data in a recipe , head to the datasets tab in the data manager .
open the replicated data tab , and select create new recipe from the actions list next to the data you want to prepare .
278 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates note :  you can also add replicated data as lookup data in a recipe .
considerations for using wave connectors before using wave connectors , review these considerations . •
you can create up to 20 connections , regardless of type .
this limit does not include salesforce local connections .
• wave can extract up to either 20 million rows or 10 gb from an object , depending on which limit is reached first . •
you can replicate data from up to 50 objects in wave .
this total includes local and external objects . •
incremental extracts and filters are only available with the salesforce local connector .
see also : extract replicated data with the digest transformation create dataflows with clicks , not code create and edit your dataflows visually without a single line of code , using the dataflow editor .
add fields and objects in seconds ; create complete dataflows in minutes .
no more downloading , editing , and uploading json files .
to use the editor , head over to the data manager and locate your dataflow on the dataflows & recipes tab .
open the actions menu , and click edit .
279 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates if you ’re creating a new dataflow , you ’re taken to the editor automatically .
note :  you can create multiple dataflows if you have enabled replication .
the dataflow editor visually displays the dataflow you ’re editing .
the canvas ( 1 ) shows the individual nodes in your dataflow and the links between them .
if you ca n’t find a node , enter the node name in the search box ( 2 ) to focus on that node .
the node palette ( 3 ) has buttons for each type of node .
click one to add it to the canvas .
use the buttons at the top of the editor ( 4 ) to work with the dataflow json .
preview and download the underlying json or upload an existing json file to work with it in the editor .
the dataflow in this example extracts data from the salesforce opportunity , account , and user objects , joins it together , and creates a registered dataset . 280 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates
here are some dataflow essentials to get you started use a dataflow to extract data into wave , transform it , and load it into a dataset .
each step in this process is performed by a node , with data flowing from one node to the next through links .
each node performs one of three main functions .
• extract nodes bring in data from a salesforce object , a replicated object , or an existing dataset .
start your dataflow with one or more of these .
these nodes output data to other nodes .
in the editor , look for the output arrow on the right of these nodes . •
prepare nodes transform the data .
for example , you can join data from different nodes , add calculated fields , and filter rows .
these nodes receive data from and output data to other nodes .
look for the input and output arrows at each end of these nodes .
note :  the delta transformation is not available in the dataflow editor . •
the register node creates a dataset with the resulting data and makes it available for use .
end your dataflow with one of these .
this node receives data from one other node only .
look for the input arrow on the left of this node .
take a walk through editing a dataflow imagine you ’re the wave admin at blue sky solar , a company selling and installing solar panels in california and arizona .
you ’re using wave connectors to replicate opportunity data from your arizona org , and you want to merge this with your local california data .
these are the steps you take .
281 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates 1 .
you start editing your dataflow , and the first thing you see is the new visual view .
here , your dataflow is already extracting sales data from your local california org . 2 .
in the node palette , click the digest node button ( ) .
this node extracts data from replicated objects .
3 . give the node a unique name and click continue .
4 .
complete the node attributes and click save .
note :  attributes that reference connections , objects , fields , or other nodes let you search and select values from a list .
say goodbye to dataflows failing because you mistyped a field name !
tip :  see transformations for wave dataflows to learn more about the specific attributes for each node .
5 .
add an append node in the same way .
the append node has a sources attribute where you select the input nodes .
282 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates the nodes are connected on the canvas .
tip :  you can drag the output arrow of a source node to draw a link to another node on the canvas .
6 .
add a register node , specifying the append node as the source .
7 .
stand back and marvel at how quickly you edited your dataflow to extract and append external data , and register the result as a new dataset .
and no code !
tip :  when you add a node to the canvas , it does n’t always land where you want it .
just drag it to wherever you want .
as you add more nodes , it can get crowded on the canvas .
if your browser supports it , use your scroll wheel to zoom in and out , or drag the canvas to move nodes into view .
do n’t forget to update the dataflow when you ’re done editing , click update dataflow to update the definition file with your changes .
wave validates your dataflow to ensure that you provided all the required attribute values , and you ca n’t continue if there are errors .
correct the errors it finds before trying again . updating the dataflow
does not run it .
you only see the results when the dataflow next runs .
283 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates important :  updating a dataflow overwrites the existing dataflow .
note :  if you haven’t quite finished , click the download json button ( ) to save your work as a json file without updating the dataflow .
when you 're ready to resume , click the upload json ( ) button to load the dataflow back into the editor .
extract replicated data with the digest transformation use the new digest transformation in a dataflow to extract data replicated through local and external connections .
here ’s an example . let ’s say you ’re extracting opportunity data from your company ’s org in arizona using a salesforce external connection .
you want to append this data to opportunity data from your local california org using the dataflow .
add a digest node in the dataflow editor or the dataflow definition file , specify the connection name , object , and fields , and you ’re done .
digest node in dataflow editor digest node in dataflow json " extract arizona opportunities " : { " action " : " digest " , " parameters " : { " connectionname " : " arizona_sales " , " object " : " opportunity " , " fields " : [ { " name " : " closedate " } , { " name " : " amount " } , { " name " : " stagename " } , { " name " : " name " } ] , } } , tip :  the connection name is the api name of the connection used to replicate the data .
on the setup tab of the data manager , look for the name in parentheses next to the replicated object that you are extracting from .
284 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates you can then use an append node in the dataflow to merge opportunities from your california and arizona orgs .
note :  the digest transformation is available only if you have enabled replication .
learn about dataflow validation enhancements wave now validates your dataflows when you upload the definition files .
previously , validation on upload occurred only when you had replication enabled .
without replication , you only learned of errors when the dataflow ran .
too late !
here 's what wave validates when you upload your dataflow . •
are the parameters in each node valid ? • are the node references valid ?
for example , do you have duplicate node names or circular references ?
• does the integration user have access to the extracted objects ?
wave alerts you if it finds errors and provides a description to help you fix them .
if you do n’t have replication enabled , you have the option to continue the upload with errors .
take this option if you want to fix the dataflow later , or review it in the dataflow editor .
wave does n’t let you upload a dataflow with errors if you have replication enabled .
dataflow error message with replication off dataflow error message with replication on 285 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates dataflow error message with replication off dataflow error message with replication
on note :  wave alerts you at the first error it finds and only provides details of that error , so your dataflow could contain more errors .
learn about changes to dataflow limits we updated dataflow limits to get more out of your dataflows . •
if you have replication enabled , you can now create up to 20 dataflows .
• dataflows that take less than 2 minutes to run do n’t count toward your daily dataflow run limit .
• replication jobs do n’t count toward your daily dataflow run limit .
enable new fields for replication with ease you know how it goes .
the sales operations team at your company wants to see extra opportunity fields in their dashboards .
you have replication enabled in your org , so you know that you have to update the dataflow to enable these fields .
not anymore .
use the new field picker to enable fields with just a few clicks .
no dataflow required !
in the data manager , on the setup tab , click the salesforce object that you want to enable fields for .
the field picker shows the fields available for the object .
286 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates fields already enabled for replication are already selected .
select the additional fields you want , and click continue .
preview the new data on the next page .
if you change your mind , hover over a field ’s column header and click x to disable it .
when you ’re ready , click save and the new fields are enabled .
note :  you ca n’t use the field picker or preview page to disable fields that are included in an object ’s sfdcdigest node .
to disable them , remove these fields from the sfdcdigest node .
add more flavor to your data with new recipe ingredients dataset recipes include a smorgasbord of new features to help you get even more out of your data .
bucket date fields to analyze data by whatever periods you choose .
extract components from dates to get a yearly view , or zoom in for a second - by - second look .
free numbers from their dimension fields with the dimension - to - measure transformation , and then do math on them .
and when you ’ve done all that , edit field names and labels so that your explorers really know what their data ’s telling them . 287 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates bucket date fields bucketing lets you create values based on existing values in another field .
previously , you could only do this for measure and dimension fields .
but now it ’s available for date fields too .
in a lens or dashboard , you can group the data by regular periods , such as quarter and month .
but what if you wanted to view data by some other period , like season or trimester ?
that ’s where date bucketing comes in .
let ’s say your company wants to analyze support cases by season .
now you can open up your cases dataset in a recipe and add a bucket field to show the season in which each case was opened .
to bucket a date field , click the field column header , and then click the add bucket ( default mode is absolute , which lets you specify a date range and name for each bucket .
in this example , each bucket is a season . )
button to open the bucket field dialog .
the when you ’re done , the new field appears alongside the date field you ’re bucketing .
in relative mode , each bucket is a period of time relative to the date that the recipe runs .
you can create bucket periods based on days , weeks , months , quarters , or even years .
for example , create a bucket field from the case created date to categorize cases by when they were opened .
this takes a lot of work in the dataflow , but not in a recipe ! 288 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates
when you create a relative date bucket field , enter the start and end of each period , or use the sliders .
again , when you ’re done , the new field appears alongside the date field you ’re bucketing .
find a perfect match with composite key augments when you add data in a recipe , you can now match rows using up to five pairs of lookup keys .
for example , imagine you are adding contact information to lead data in a recipe .
using names alone to match can result in duplicate matches when leads have the same name .
now , you can match on name and company to ensure you ’re matching the right data .
to use composite keys , click the add data button ( but now you also have the + add another option .
click this to select additional keys . ) and select the lookup dataset .
wave still suggests the first pair of keys if it can , 289 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates new transformations and changes the truncate transformation , which lets you create a field by taking characters from another field , is now called substring to better reflect what it does .
we also added the extract date component and convert dimension to measure transformations .
to use these transformations , click the column header of the field you want to transform , and then click the transform suggestions ( ) button .
extract date component creates a field using a date or time component from a date field in the recipe .
for example , you can extract the hour component from the case created date to analyze case creation by hour of the day .
the convert dimension to measure transformation takes numerical data in a dimension field to create a measure field .
290 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates convert numerical data so that it can be used in calculations in recipes , dataflows , lenses , and dashboards .
for example , you extracted the hour from the case created date to analyze metrics such as the average or earliest times of day cases are opened .
but the extracted hour is sitting in a dimension field !
use the convert dimension to measure transformation to free it up for statistical analysis in lenses and dashboards .
change field api names and labels you can now edit the api name and label of new fields you create in a recipe , and the labels of existing fields .
when you create fields , for example , when using bucketing or transformations , wave creates the field name for you from the source field and the action .
but createddate_grain_hour_dimensiontomeasure“closedate_delimitedsplit_1 is not all that helpful .
you can edit these generated names to make them more meaningful to the people exploring the dataset .
to change a field name or label , click the field ’s column heading , and then click the navigate fields ( click the attributes tab to change the api name and field label . )
button .
in the field navigator , note :  you can edit the api name only for new fields added in the recipe .
api names for existing fields are n’t editable .
get on track with the flexible scheduler with dependent replications , recipes , and dataflows all running on separate schedules , timing has never been more important .
the new flexible scheduler in gives you more precise control over when and how often your data jobs run , and how you receive notifications .
291 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates you ’re no longer limited to scheduling data jobs by the hour or once a day .
now you ’re free to schedule by hour , week , or month , on specific days of the week or dates in the month .
the new scheduler is there for you whenever you edit your replication schedule , create a dataset from a recipe , or schedule a dataflow .
schedule by hour schedule by hour to run the data job at specified hourly intervals .
you can specify what time the job starts each day , and on which days .
select stop queuing at a specific time to stop the data job from running after a certain time each day .
for example , set a job to start at 6:00 am , run every hour , and stop after 5:00 pm to restrict runs to just office hours .
why run a job when nobody needs it ?
schedule by week schedule by week to run the data job on a specific day or days each week .
292 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates schedule by month schedule by month to run the data job on a specific day or days each month .
by default , you can schedule the job to run on a relative day each month , for example , the first monday .
if you want the job to run on a specific date or dates , click select specific dates and then select from the list .
select relative dates select specific dates stay updated with dataflow notifications when you schedule a dataflow , you also have the option to email notifications to the dataflow creator when the dataflow runs .
you can send a notification every time the dataflow runs , only when there are warnings , or only when the dataflow fails .
293 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates note :  email notifications are only available for dataflows .
create datasets , avoid clutter we decluttered and streamlined how you get to what you love most : creating datasets .
take your usual route by clicking create on the wave home page and select dataset .
now , all your dataset creation options are displayed in a clear , simple list .
294 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates choose your data source , click continue , and away you go !
use your salesforce sharing settings in wave sharing inheritance creates a bridge between your salesforce security model and wave .
for supported objects , sharing is now an option instead of security predicates .
as a salesforce admin , you have likely labored over security , setting up sharing rules so that your users have access to data appropriate to their role .
setting up a working security model for your org is no small feat .
your company has invested a lot of time and money to get this right .
but what about wave analytics
? wave analytics has its own row - level security solution
— security predicates .
they work well , but wave administrators have to carefully replicate their salesforce security settings .
but who wants to set up security twice ?
for support objects , wave administrators no longer need to use security predicates to replicate row - level security settings in salesforce .
now you can enable the sharing inheritance feature in wave and specify which objects use it when creating datasets during the extract load and transform process .
your salesforce sharing settings are honored in wave , and you do n’t have the overhead of maintaining two distinct security models .
is sharing right for my wave org ?
as with any new feature , we recommend that you thoroughly test sharing inheritance in a sandbox environment before rolling out to production .
test against your org ’s security model , data and use cases .
complex security models in which users have access to a large number of rows can have performance implications .
it 's important to test your particular use cases to make sure sharing inheritance works for you .
in this first stage of a phased roll out of sharing for wave , we support five of the most heavily used objects : accounts , opportunities , orders , cases , and custom objects .
other objects — such as campaign , idea , site , and so on — still need to use security predicates .
sharing is n't automatically applied to all datasets , and it is n't applied by default to new datasets .
you must apply the sharing feature to each dataset manually .
if an existing dataset has a security predicate , sharing wo n't override it .
a dataset can use either sharing or a security predicate , but not both .
295 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and
wave templates getting started to enable sharing in wave : 1 .
from setup , enter wave  in the quick find box , then select settings under wave analytics . 2 .
select enable wave sharing inheritance and click save .
3 .
add " rowlevelsharingsource " to the " sfdcregister " node parameters for dataflows .
see the wave sfdcregister help page for details .
the rowlevelsharingsource  property takes a string , which should be an api name for the object from which sharing should be inherited for the dataset .
in the following example , the property specifies that the salesforce sharing rules on the opportunity object should be inherited .
" register_opportunity " : { } you can also use the rest api to do the same thing .
the sharingsource  property on the /wave / datasets/${datasetid}/versions/${versionid }  endpoint specifies the object from which sharing rules are inherited for that dataset version . " action":"register " ,
" parameters " : { " label":"opportunity with security " , " name":"opportunity_with_security " , " rowlevelsharingsource":"opportunity " } , " sources " : [ ] " extract_opportunity " 296 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates sharing inheritance or security predicate settings are used by the dataflow for the first run — when the first dataset version is created .
to make subsequent changes , edit the settings on the current dataset version .

enable actionable insights with clicks not code with actions , users can act on insights directly from wave .
you no longer have to edit the extended metadata ( xmd ) file to display salesforce standard and custom actions in wave dashboards and lenses .
now you can quickly and easily set them up with just a few clicks .
add an action menu to any dataset field except a measure .
action menus allow users to open urls , open salesforce records , or perform salesforce actions , like create an account .
these actions appear in wave chart legends and table cells .
297 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates actions appear in wave chart legends and table cells based on the field .
for instance , if you set up an action on the opportunity name field , a user can click an opportunity name in a wave table to perform the action on a record in salesforce .
to set up actions in wave , follow these steps . 1 .
select edit from the dropdown list on the dataset .
2 . click configure actions .
3 .
in the left pane of the configure actions in wave screen , select the dimension ( a qualitative dataset field ) where you want the action menu to appear .
298 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates 4 .
for record id field , select the dataset field that contains the record id of the object that you want to perform the action on .
for instance , if the dataset has opportunity id and account id fields , select account id to perform actions on the account records .
wave uses the id to identify the salesforce object and record to perform the action on .
5 .
for display fields , choose which dataset fields to show users to help them pick the correct record .
when a user invokes the action from wave , the action can apply to multiple salesforce records , so the user needs to choose a record . specifying the dataset fields limits the choices .
for example , if you enable actions on opportunity records , you can show the opportunity name , account name , and opportunity owner name to help users pick the right opportunity .
6 .
to enable users to open a salesforce record or url , select open salesforce record , choose the action in the open field , and then enter a tooltip .
users see the tooltip when they hover over the action .
choose one of the following actions .
299 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates action salesforce record salesforce record ( multiple orgs ) url description opens the salesforce record .
wave searches for the record in the same org in which it ’s running .
opens a salesforce record from another org .
if the dataset contains records from multiple orgs , select this option .
in the org id field , select the dataset field that contains the org id .
to enable wave to connect to each org , select manage orgs and specify the url for each org .
opens a url .
use the following syntax to pass a dataset field as a parameter in the url : { { row.<dataset_field_dev_name > } } for example , http://www.google.com?q={{row.accountname } } if you do n’t specify the url , wave uses the org ’s url .
for example , you can just specify the following parameter to open the account record in salesforce : /{{row .
accountid } } wave retrieves the account id from the accountid field in the dataset record .
7 .
to enable users to perform actions on a salesforce record , select perform salesforce actions and then choose the actions .
the list of actions varies based on the object specified in record id field .
option all actions choose actions description adds all actions defined in the page layout for this object , including new ones created later .
select from the list of currently available actions .
note :  the list contains a superset of all actions defined in all page layouts for the salesforce object
. 300 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates note :  a wave user sees only the actions that you select and that are assigned to the user ’s page layout .
if the predefined actions on the salesforce1 and lightning experience pages are overridden , wave displays only the actions that are added to both the quick actions in salesforce classic publisher and salesforce1 and lightning experience actions sections of the page layout .

301 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates define richer widget interactions with enhanced bindings support dynamically set the initial selection in a step based on a binding .
use bindings to generate custom titles for the chart , date , link , list , number , and range widgets .
to create more intricate logic , nest bindings .
control the initial view of a dashboard with bound selections you can use a results binding to dynamically set the initial filter selection in a staticflex- , saql- , or soql - type step .
for example , to focus the dashboard on the logged - in user ’s country , configure the list widget to select the country when the dashboard first opens .
to enable this behavior , first , create a step that retrieves the country of the logged - in user from the salesforce user object .
" userdata " : { " groups " : [ ] , " numbers " : [ ] , " query " : " select username , country , firstname , lastlogindate from user where name = ' ! { user.name } ' " , " selectmode " : " single " , " strings " : [ " username " , " country " , " firstname " , " lastlogindate " ] , " type " : " soql " } next , bind the initial selection in the list widget ’s step to the logged - in user ’s country . " billing_country_2 " : { " groups " : [ ] , " isfacet " : true , " label " : " billing country " , " numbers " : [ ] , " query " : " q = load \"opp_icons\";\n q = group q by ' billing_country';\n q = foreach q generate ' billing_country ' as ' billing_country ' , sum('amount ' ) 302 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates as ' sum_amount';\n q = order q by ' sum_amount ' desc ; " , " selectmode " : " multi " , " start " : " { { cell(userdata.result , 0 , \"country\").asobject ( ) } } " , " strings " : [ ] , " type " : " saql " , " useglobal " : true } use nested bindings to show results based on dependent widgets nested bindings create deeper dependencies among widgets .
for example , the following pie chart shows the number of opportunities for each segment .
it filters the results based on the selected grouping in the toggle widget and selected value from that grouping in the horizontal bar chart .
to enable the pie chart to filter based on the value of the selected grouping , the step query contains a nested binding .
q = load \"opportunities1\";\n q = filter q by { { column(revenuedynamicgrouping.selection , column(staticgroupingnames.selection , [ \"value\"])).asequality ( cell(staticgroupingnames.selection , 0 , \"value\ " ) ) } } ; \n q = group q by ' segment';\n q = foreach q generate ' segment ' as ' segment ' , count ( ) as ' count';\n q = order q by ' segment ' asc;\nq = limit q 200 ; convert binding results to an array when a binding function requires the input to be an array , use the toarray data manipulation binding function .
for example , use this function to convert the scalar result of a cell function to an array , which is required by compact - form measures , groups , and order clauses .
the toarray function uses the following syntax : toarray ( input1 , input2 , . .
. )
the input for the toarray function must be scalars ( including static values ) or one - dimensional arrays .
this function converts scalars to a one - dimensional array and one - dimensional arrays to a two - dimensional array .
the function returns an error if the input is a series of static one - dimensional arrays , a two - dimensional array , or a mix of scalars and one - dimensional arrays . 303 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates
to better understand this function , consider the following opportunities step .
oppty_name owner alpha bravo charlie danny danny jeff region americas americas emea amount created_date 1000 500 2000 2/20/2017 4/15/2017 5/1/2017 now let ’s look at some binding examples that use the opportunities step as a source . binding toarray ( cell(opportunities.selection , 0 , “ region ” ) ) toarray ( “ apac ” ) toarray ( cell(opportunities.selection , 0 , “ region ” ) , “ apac ” ) toarray ( column(opportunities.selection , [ “ oppty_name ” ] ) , column(opportunities.selection , [ “ region ] ) toarray ( column(opportunities.selection , [ “ oppty_name ” , “ region ” ] ) ) toarray ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] ) result [ “ americas ”
] [ “ apac ” ] [ “ americas ” , “ apac ” ] [ [ “ alpha ” , “ bravo ” , “ charlie ” ] , [ “ americas ” , “
americas ”
, “ emea ” ] ] error .
the column binding function returns a two - dimensional array , which is an invalid input .
error .
the input ca n’t be a series of static one - dimensional arrays .

in addition to the height , you can configure the following attributes of the embedded wave analytics dashboard . • show sharing icon —
add the share icon on the dashboard .
users can click the icon to open the share dialog , where they can post to chatter and download images and data . •
show title — control the visibility of the dashboard title . •
open links in new windows —
specify where links from the dashboard to other assets are opened .
• hide on error— control whether the wave analytics dashboard appears if there is an error , such as the dashboard ca n’t be found . •
filter — configure the embedded dashboard to show only the data that ’s relevant for the record being viewed .
the filter attribute links data fields in the dashboard to the object ’s fields .
in this example , the dashboard is filtered by the account name on the record page and shows only data related to that account name .
{ ' datasets':{'account':[{'fields':['name ' ] , ' filter':{'operator ' : ' matches ' , ' values':['$name ' ] } } ] } } this example applies the account name as a selection .
with the selection option , the dashboard displays all its data , and the specified values are highlighted .

create the app with one click without using the configuration wizard .
basic creation uses standard , default settings . •
custom creation .
use the configuration wizard to choose your own , custom settings to reflect the way you and others on your team want to view data .
if you choose this option , the wizard asks you to choose salesforce objects to add to sales wave .
select the ones you want based on how you use salesforce and what data you want to see in the app .
309 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates when you create your app , sales wave first checks your org to be sure it has the required data to successfully create all the app ’s datasets and dashboards .
if it does n’t , error messages tell you what you need to add to your org before creating the app .
the compatibility check determines the following : • default settings to use for basic app creation . •
the questions and possible answers you see in the configuration wizard you use for custom app creation . •
the objects you can choose to add to the app .
collaborative forecasting support for collaborative forecasting gives you a great way to get quotas data in the app ’s dashboards .
it also makes it easier to drill into forecast data in sales wave dashboards .
if you use the sales cloud collaborative forecasts feature to store quotas , you no longer have to manually upload a quota .csv file to sales wave for quotas to be shown in sales wave dashboards .
during the compatibility check , the app checks to see if your org uses collaborative forecasts .
if it does , sales wave automatically adds data from the forecasts object during basic creation .
if you choose custom create , sales wave includes a question that lets you add forecasts data .
what if your org does n’t use collaborative forecasts , or if you do n’t store quotas data using the feature ?
create a .csv file based on quotas data you store outside salesforce and import it into your app .
see # bi_app_sales_wave_update_dataset__bi_app_sales_wave_update_dataset.xml .
collaborative forecasting also makes it easier to visualize forecasts in sales wave dashboards .
that can help you more easily fine - tune forecasting metrics , for example by comparing opportunity forecasts to forecast adjustments .
the app also supports the salesforce collaborative forecasting hierarchy , and you see forecast manager names instead of role names in dashboard widgets .

introducing wave templates turn your wave platform app into a template that colleagues , partners , and customers can use to create new versions of the app built from their own data .
what if you create a wave app from scratch and you want others use it , but populate it with their own data ?
maybe you ’ve developed a great app with dashboards that track time - to - close for new accounts , and you want to make it available to partners and other divisions of your company .
or an app that pinpoints the efficiency of phone sales and service teams and you want to sell it to customers .
wave templates lets you do just that .
after creating an app , developers can create a template based on the app using wave templates .
you can use the template to distribute your wave platform app the same way that salesforce markets the sales wave analytics and service wave analytics prebuilt apps .
user permissions
to develop with wave templates : • use wave analytics templated apps • manage wave analytics templated apps • manage wave analytics 315 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates the template ’s like a floorplan for a house : the plan determines the overall layout of the rooms , their shape , size , and so on , and others get to figure out what to put in the rooms and exactly how they ’re used .
your template sets the organization and components of an app — dashboards , widgets , queries , look and feel , and so on .
others can use it to create an app that uses their own data .
then , depending on the flexibility you ’ve built in to the app template , they can customize it to meet their own requirements .
create a template : process at a glance an app you build using the wave platform can become the “
master app”—the basis for your template .
once you have your app , develop a template using the following general process : 1 .
create a wavetemplate object for the app by making an api post call to the /services / data / v39.0/wave / templates endpoint of the wave rest api .
this creates json files that are the basis of the template . 2 .
export the wavetemplate object ’s json files from the metadata api .
3 .
edit the json files to determine the user interface for the app ’s configuration wizard ( if it includes one ) as well as to determine template variables , conditions , and rules .
leave the json as is to create a template that ’s identical to the master app .
you can use the result to test that the template was created correctly .
or edit the json to add any user options you ’d like to maximize the flexibility . 4 .
deploy the wavetemplate object with calls to the metadata api that push the changed files back into the database .
5 .
test the template by retrieving the object from the metadata api . 6 .
distribute the template to users , partners , and customers who can then build their own apps from it .
prerequisites your org needs the following for you to use wave templates : 1 .
preference settings .
set your org preferences to enable wave templates .
in the admin setup page , under wave settings , select enable wave templates .
you 'll need this to create wave template assets in the form of json files .
2 . wave rest api access .
refer to the documentation on authentication to the wave rest api to access and use the api .
3 .
metadata api access .
refer to the metadata api developer 's guide to access and use the metadata api .
see the wave templates developer guide for complete details .
updates to the rest api review the latest updates to the rest api and associated representations .
the apis for data connectors and recipes are now generally available .
import data with wave data connectors wave data connectors for importing data from non - salesforce sources are now supported in the api through the following endpoints . /wave
/ dataconnectors a collection of wave data connectors . /wave / dataconnectors/${connectorid } returns data connection properties . /wave
/ dataconnectortypes a collection of wave data connector types . /wave
/ dataconnectors/${connectorid}/sourceobjects/${sourceobjectname}/fields a list of source fields of a particular source object . 316 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates /wave / dataconnectors/${connectorid}/sourceobjects
a list of all source objects that the named data connector knows about . /wave
/ dataconnectors/${connectorid}/sourceobjects/${sourceobjectname}/data source object data represents data that the data connector knows about .
when a source object is replicated into wave , it can be used to create datasets . /wave
/ dataconnectors/${connectorid}/sourceobjects/${sourceobjectname } a source object represents a specific category or type of data that the data connector knows about .
when a source object is replicated into wave , it can be used to create datasets . /wave

say hello to the wave apex sdk and send well - formed saql queries to wave .
this first phase of the wave apex sdk lets developers build saql queries and execute them in the security context of the logged - in user , ensuring that security settings are honored .
api versioning is supported to avoid breaking applications as the sdk evolves .
the sdk also offers wave .
invalidparameterexception  to help catch bad values supplied to the class methods .
digging deeper connectapi .
wave.executequery 317 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates
at its simplest , use the executequery function ( exposed through the connectapi namespace ) to pass a saql query from an apex page to wave , and get a response in the form of json .
for example , this sample sends ‘ your saql query’ to wave .
string query = ' [ your saql query ] ' ; connectapi .
literaljson result = connectapi .
wave.executequery(query ) ; string response = result.json ; sending queries like this is very useful , but relies on the developer coding well - formed saql queries .
would n’t it be great if a class constructed the queries for you ?
wave .
querybuilder exposed through the wave namespace , the querybuilder class is the most convenient , preferred , and safest way to construct a saql query string for execution .
it ’s not an exhaustive implementation of all possible saql queries —
so sometimes you need to write your own — but it does cover the vast majority of use cases , including : • load dataset statement • foreach statement • group statement • order statement • limit statement • filter statement • functions such as min , max , count , avg , unique , as , sum use querybuilder and its associated classes , wave .
projectionnode  and wave .
querynode , to incrementally build your saql statement .
for example : wave .
projectionnode [ ] projs = new wave .
projectionnode [ ] { wave .
querybuilder.get('state').alias('state ' ) , wave .
querybuilder.get('city').alias('city ' ) , wave .
querybuilder.get('revenue').avg().alias('avg_revenue ' ) , wave .
querybuilder.get('revenue').sum().alias('sum_revenue ' ) , wave . querybuilder.count().alias('count ' ) } ; connectapi .
literaljson result = wave .
querybuilder.load('0fbd00000004dszkam ' , ' 0fcd00000004fezka2 ' ) .group(new string[]{'state ' , ' city ' } ) .foreach(projs ) .execute('q ' ) ; string response = result.json ; examples querybuilder is the core of this first phase of the wave apex sdk , so let ’s take a closer look .
here ’s a simple count query .
wave .
projectionnode [ ] projs = new wave .
projectionnode[]{wave .
querybuilder.count().alias('c ' ) } ; string query = wave .
querybuilder.load('datasetid ' , ' datasetversionid').group().foreach(projs).build('q ' ) ; 318 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates the resulting saql query looks like this : q = load " datasetid / datasetversionid " ; q = group q by all ; q = foreach q generate count as c ; here ’s a more complex example that uses a union statement .
wave .
projectionnode [ ] projs = new wave .
projectionnode[]{wave .
querybuilder.get('name ' ) , wave .
querybuilder.get('annualrevenue').alias('revenue ' ) } ; wave .
querynode nodeone = wave .
querybuilder.load('datasetone','datasetversionone').foreach(projs ) ; wave .
querynode nodetwo = wave .
querybuilder.load('datasettwo ' , ' datasetversiontwo').foreach(projs ) ; string query = wave .
querybuilder.union(new list < wave .
querynode>{nodeone , nodetwo}).build('q ' ) ; the resulting saql query has two projection streams , qa  and qb .
qa = load " datasetone / datasetversionone " ; qa = foreach q generate name , annualrevenue as revenue ; qb = load " datasettwo / datasetversiontwo " ; qb = foreach q generate name , annualrevenue as revenue ; q = union qa , qb ; resources for more information on using the wave apex sdk , see the apex developer guide and the wave sdk developer guide .
communicate with wave dashboards using the web sdk
easily interact with wave in custom applications .
use lightning components for visualforce , or your preferred development environment .
would you like your application to communicate with your wave dashboards , whether your application is built with the lightning sdk , visualforce , or mobile ?
how about from an application outside of salesforce ?
would n’t it be great if your application could apply filters or know about dashboard selections and filters made by a user ?
your application could take actions specific for your business if values fall outside of defined ranges .
or you could have an application that is a viewpoint for dashboards made available by different parts of your business application ecosystem .
imagine that : a single information source to present to your executive staff ! salesforce introduces the wave analytics web sdk .
the events we ’re making available in this release are the foundation for a new way of thinking about wave applications .
coupled with the lockerservice , you can even code your application outside of salesforce —
you can interact with wave from any javascript application .
sdk events wave : update use this event to dynamically set the filter on a wave dashboard or interact with the dashboard by dynamically changing the selection .
it has three attributes : the unique id of the wave asset on which to apply the filter , the payload , and the asset type ( currently only dashboard ) .
the payload is a json string that identifies the datasets and any dimensions and field values .
wave : selectionchanged this event is fired by a wave dashboard for consumption by custom lightning components .
it provides the following attributes : the id of the dashboard that fired the event and the payload .
the payload object contains the selection information — the name of the step 319 salesforce summer release notes wave analytics : einstein discovery , easier data management and exploration , and wave templates involved when changing the selection and an array of objects representing the current selection .
each object in the array contains one or more attributes based on the selection .
note :  to use these events , you need the wave platform license insights builder psl .
setting a filter this is a lightning component example , where a component has already been defined , handlers have been set , and the update event has been registered in the custom component markup .
but the controller is where the exciting stuff happens .
the code shows how to construct the payload for the update event — in this case , setting stagename to close won in the oppty_test dashboard .
( { doinit : function(component , event , helper ) { component.set('v.filter ' , ' { " oppty_test " : { " stagename " : [ " closed won " ] } } ' ) ; handlesendfilter : function(component , event , helper ) { var filter = component.get('v.filter ' ) ; var dashboardid = component.get('v.dashboardid ' ) ; var evt = $ a.get('e.wave : update ) ; } , } } ) evt.setparams ( { i d : dashboardid , value : filter , type : " dashboard " } ) ; evt.fire ( ) ;
reacting to a selection here ’s another lightning component example .
the component has already been defined and everything is registered , so this code shows the fun stuff in the controller — how to receive and iterate through the payload .
the payload is an array of objects representing the current selection .
( { handleselectionchanged : function(component , event , helper ) { var params = event.getparams ( ) ; var payload = params.payload ; if ( payload ) { var step = payload.step ; var data = payload.data ; data.foreach(function(obj ) { for ( var k in obj ) { if ( k = = = ' i d ' ) { component.set("v.recordid " , obj[k ] ) ; } } } ) ; } } } ) payload data can contain other objects , each in turn containing key - value pairs .
for example , aside from the i d , you can also get the noun ( for example , " dashboard " ) and the verb ( for example , " selection " ) .

get more criteria - based audiences criteria - based audiences work with page variations to let you target specific audiences with specific pages .
previously , you had to create a whole bunch of different page variations and set criteria on each one .
now , you can create a set of criteria for an audience , and apply the same audience to multiple page variations .
starting summer ‘ 17 , we ’re making some major tweaks and vast improvements on how you set up audiences .
this functionality is available in communities that are based on the customer service ( napili ) , partner central , and lightning bolt solutions .
let ’s take a look at how we ’ve improved the page variation and audience experience . •
if you had page variations and their criteria already set up in your community , we ’ve now moved them into criteria - based audiences .
they are now labeled as audience 1 , audience 2 , and so forth .
hover over an audience to see its criteria , and give it the name it deserves . •
we ’ve added new criteria ( domain and city ) to help you set hyper - local and hyper - specific audiences ( if that floats your boat ) . •
the new domain criteria shows your page variation just to users of the selected community domain or domains . –
note :  domain criteria is not available in sandbox or developer orgs . •
we ’ve updated the user interface so creating and managing audiences is a cinch . 328 salesforce summer release notes community 360 empowers support agents to better help customers ( pilot ) note :  here are some best practices to keep in mind to get the best performance from your page variations and audiences : • think big picture .
for example , if you have a page variation for a city that you do n’t think will get much traffic , expand the location area ( to state or country ) . •
combine , combine , combine .
instead of creating separate audiences for low traffic areas , try combining criteria to increase the traffic to your page .
for example , let ’s say you want audiences for the same profile criteria but different locations .
instead of having separate audiences for seattle , bellevue , and redmond , create one audience and add all three in the location criteria .
the result targets users in seattle , bellevue , or redmond . •
stick to big differences .
while it ’s tempting create super - specific audiences and page variations , limit yourself to those variations that are significantly different .
if there are minimal differences in pages , such as content of a component , use actions to dynamically vary the component content instead .
community 360 empowers support agents to better help customers ( pilot ) community 360 shows support agents working in the console which articles and cases customers have accessed in the community .
agents can use this information to check if customers have already looked at pertinent documentation , or already filed a case before calling support .

embedded login extends the login experience configured for your community to deliver the same capabilities on your website .
your web developers can add login capabilities to a web page with just a few lines of html .
salesforce handles authentication so that your web developers can focus on what they do best — delivering an amazing user experience .

change sets are now available for lightning communities and salesforce tabs + visualforce communities , making it easy to move your community between orgs that have a deployment connection .
create , customize , and test your community in your sandbox environment and then migrate the community to production when testing is complete .
to create an outbound change set for a community , go to outbound change sets in setup and choose the network component type .
add your community to the change set and include the dependent components .
we recommend selecting all the dependencies listed .
keep the following considerations and limitations in mind when migrating a community with change sets . •
for communities , you can only make updates with change sets , which means that you ca n’t create a new community directly from an inbound change set .
instead , in the destination org , first create a community with the same name and then deploy the inbound change set . •
when you deploy an inbound change set , it completely overwrites the community in the destination org .
for example , let ’s say you delete pages from a community in sandbox and then create an updated outbound change set .
when you redeploy the change set in a destination org , such as production , the pages are deleted there also . •
navigation menu items are supported .
however , for menu items that link to objects , list views are reset to the default list view .
also , custom list views for standard objects are n't included as dependencies .
• only the following administration settings ( in workspaces or community management ) are supported : – change password page – forgot password page – home page – login page – allow internal users to log in directly to the community option •
the following items are n’t supported : – page variations and audience targeting – navigational and featured topics – languages community migration is also supported via the metadata api .
upgrade community user licenses in a blink upgrade users with customer licenses to either the customer community plus or the partner community license .
yes , you no longer have to create entirely new users and migrate their data .
yes , you ’re very welcome !
previously , you had to create another user identity , migrate the user ’s existing data over , and associate it with the new user identity .
now , you can upgrade the user with a few button clicks .
aside from being quicker , the new license upgrade approach offers many advantages . •
you no longer need to re - create users in the system or migrate their data . •
users can keep their existing usernames and passwords .
a license upgrade also preserves historical record and chatter data .
ensure that users have access to the same objects via their new license and profile .
plus , with the new licenses , users can take advantage of advanced sharing features , reports and dashboards , and role - based data access .
who is eligible for a license upgrade ?
330 salesforce summer release notes upgrade community user licenses in a blink in general , we support upgrades from most customer licenses to the customer community plus or partner community license .
more specifically , for users whose usertype  equals cspliteportal , we support license upgrades to powerpartner  or powercustomersuccess  ( in the salesforce api ) .
you can upgrade the following licenses to the customer community plus or partner community license without any loss of data access . •
customer community • high volume customer portal • overage high volume customer portal • authenticated website user overage • authenticated website user • external identity warning :  other customer licenses associated with the cspliteportal  user type also support license upgrades , but with some loss of data access .
for example , users could lose access to some objects they previously had access to .
in other cases , the new license might not include one or more user permissions available with the previous license .
we strongly recommend that you explore which permissions are affected before you upgrade a user ’s license .
the user ’s new license , profile , and permission set assignments should ideally provide at least the same or comparable level of data access as previous assignments .
how do i upgrade users ?
to change a user ’s license in salesforce , go to their user detail page and click edit .
specify a new license , profile , and role .
and if you want to upgrade users via the salesforce api , for a single user or multiple users , we ’ve got you covered !
use the update ( ) method on the user  object and specify the required profileid  and roleid values .
that ’s it .
important considerations a few things to bear in mind before you upgrade a user ’s license . •
the customer community plus and partner community licenses require the user to have a role , which imposes certain restrictions . –
an upgrade to a license that requires a role is irreversible . –
if you do n’t specify a role during the license upgrade , we assign the lowest role in the account hierarchy to the user .
if no roles exist on the account , we create one for you and assign it to the user . –
automatic role assignments always use the lowest role associated with the user ’s account : partner < account name > user  or customer < account name > user .
so if you want to move them up in the role hierarchy , you can easily do so later . •
before upgrading a user to a partner community license , enable the user ’s account as a partner account .
tip :
a partner account can have both customer and partner users , so customer users on the account are n’t affected when you enable it as a partner account . •
a license upgrade removes sharing sets , permission sets , and permission set license assignments previously associated with the user . •
license upgrades are subject to org limits that apply to user creation , such as license and role limits and username uniqueness requirements .
after you upgrade a user ’s license : • changes in profiles and permission sets can affect community membership .
ensure that upgraded users have access to the intended communities .
331 salesforce summer release notes lightning bolt : package more easily and distribute on appexchange • we recalculate sharing rules that apply to upgraded users , for example through their public groups , criteria - based sharing , and record ownership ( implicit sharing ) . •
users upgraded to the customer community plus license are automatically associated with the all customer portal users public group .
similarly , users upgraded to the partner community license are associated with the all partner users public group .

for example , some components that take { ! recordid }  as a parameter expect to get this value from the page ’s url .
if you add the component to a page that does n't pass this value through the url , you must manually provide it .
similarly , let ’s say you add the group detail component , which requires a { ! recordid }  value , to the case detail page instead of the group detail page .
although both pages pass a { ! recordid }  value , the id that case detail passes is incorrect .

customers can install new major and bug fix versions of the downloadable apps from the app store and google play as long as their mobile devices meet salesforce ’s current minimum mobile operating system requirements .
if a device is running an older operating system , updated versions of salesforce1 do n’t appear in the app stores .
customer support services for salesforce1 salesforce customer support uses commercially reasonable efforts to troubleshoot issues with salesforce1 , provided : • a user ’s device meets current minimum platform requirements • downloadable app users have the most recent version of salesforce1 installed when customers run salesforce1 on salesforce - tested devices , it ’s more efficient for us to troubleshoot issues with the mobile app .
for customers using untested devices , even those meeting minimum platform requirements , we might not be able to replicate some issues due to device manufacturer – specific customizations .

two prior to this latest release , salesforcea security and permission settings were managed by one single connected app that supported both android and ios .
security and permission settings for the new salesforcea for android version 3.1 and salesforcea for ios version 3.4 are controlled by each separate connected app , respectively .
note :  earlier versions of the salesforcea will continue to have security and permission settings controlled by the original single connected app .
separating the single salesforcea connected app into two dedicated connected apps for both android and ios lets you control security and permission settings for each platform individually .
these benefits include more clarity to login history , oauth usage , and better accommodation for future enhancements .
the new salesforcea connected apps for both android and ios are automatically installed with default security and permission settings ( for example , refresh token valid until revoked and pin lock disabled ) upon first use of salesforcea for android version 3.1 and salesforcea for ios version 3.4 .
no action is necessary if your org does n’t require custom connected app security and permission settings .
if your org has custom security and permission settings in place through the original single salesforcea connected app , you can replicate those settings at any time in the separate salesforcea connected apps for android and ios .
see salesforcea connected apps administration on the app exchange to install the new separate connected apps before the first use of salesforcea for android version 3.1 and salesforcea for ios version 3.4 .

rich text editors had been disabled when the lockerservice critical update was active .
the new version has some visual and formatting differences from the rich text editor that you were familiar with .
this change applies to lightning experience and all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .
no changes have been made to rich text editors in salesforce classic .
you get the following features in lightning experience and salesforce1 .
• format text as bold , italicized , underlined , or strikethrough • create bulleted and numbered lists •
change paragraph indentation • insert a hyperlink • insert an image • remove formatting the new rich text editors for custom fields in lightning experience and salesforce1 have the following differences , as compared to the rich text editors in salesforce classic . •
the text alignment buttons ( 1 ) are displayed after the list and indentation buttons . •
the remove formatting button ( 2 ) clears text formatting . •
the default font family ( 3 ) is salesforce sans , arial , sans - serif , instead of arial , verdana , trebuchet ms , sans - serif . •
the undo and redo buttons are no longer available .
you can use keyboard shortcuts to undo and redo content formatting .
in windows , undo your last action by pressing ctrl+z , and reverse your last undo by pressing ctrl+y. on mac os , use cmd+z and cmd+y.
alternatively , use the edit menu in your browser to undo or redo your changes .
note :  we recommend using the toolbar to format your content .
the rich text editor provides only a wysiwyg interface .
you ca n’t edit html tags .
when you copy content from a web page or another source and paste it into the editor , unsupported tags are removed .
text that was enclosed in unsupported tags is preserved as plain text . formatting support
the power of the rich text editor is in its wysiwyg interface , therefore type in the editor and use the toolbar to format your content as much as you can .
when you paste formatted content from another source , you can expect some formatting differences in lightning experience and salesforce1 .
here are formatting considerations to look out for .
warning :  if you add a custom rich text area field in salesforce classic and edit it in lightning experience , you can also expect the formatting differences .
saving your changes in lightning experience overwrites the original formatting you had in salesforce 435 salesforce summer release notes setup : right - click to navigate , shorter load times in object manager classic and conversely .
alternatively , you can fix some of the formatting using the toolbar or switch to salesforce classic to perform your edits .
definition lists formatting for definition lists is preserved , but the styling appears different in lightning experience and salesforce1 .
definition terms are not bold .
fonts pasting text with a predefined font face , color , or size converts the font  tag into a span  tag with the style attribute .
headings inline styles on h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , and h6  tags are not supported and are ignored .
hyperlinks hyperlinks always open in a new window or tab in lightning experience and salesforce1 .
if you enter a hyperlink with a different target  value in salesforce classic and edit the rich text field in lightning experience or salesforce1 , the target  value is converted to _ blank .
inline styles in salesforce classic , inline styles are supported on div , span , p , br , and hr  tags .
in lightning experience and salesforce1 , inline styles are supported only on span  tags .
lists nesting a bulleted list within a numbered list and nesting a numbered list within a bulleted list are not supported .
nesting a numbered list within a bulleted list ( 4 ) converts the numbered list into a bulleted list ( 5 ) when it ’s pasted into the editor , while nesting a bulleted list within a numbered list ( 6 ) converts the bulleted list into a numbered list ( 7 ) .
warning :  if you edit an existing rich text area field containing a nested list of a different type in lightning experience and salesforce1 , the nested list is converted to the same type as its parent list as described previously .
look for continued improvements for nested lists in future releases .
nested lists of the same type are supported .
however , pasting a nested list into the editor flattens the list into one list in lightning experience and salesforce1 .
for example , a nested bulleted list within a bulleted list ( 8) becomes a single bulleted list ( 9 ) when pasted .
for nested lists of the same type , as shown by ( 8) and ( 9 ) , use the toolbar to adjust your list formatting .
you can also press the tab key or shift+tab to create a nested list item or remove a nested list item .

editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer , editions block execution of javascript in the hyperlink function ( critical update )
previously , you could use javascript to prepare the url argument in a hyperlink function .
however , this approach introduces a security vulnerability because javascript can include cross - site scripting and make the url execute on behalf of users .
this critical update blocks the execution of javascript used to specify a url in the hyperlink function .
editions before activating this update , we recommend that you review the use of javascript in hyperlink functions in your salesforce org and begin migration toward alternative solutions .
here are some possible workarounds . •

the time type is essentially a timestamp without the date included .

be aware of these behaviors when using the time type . •
the time type uses a 24-hour notation . •
you can display time in hh : mm , for example , 14:40 . •
time values are not localized or associated with a time zone .
for example , if you enter 15:00 , for 3 pm , all users see the same value .

editions available in all editions let ’s say you want a custom picklist field on an opportunity object to track the priority of a particular opportunity .
in addition , you want to have a default priority for the opportunities that are being created .
but what if you want to set up a different default priority for another group of users ?
imagine that you have a fast response sales team in your org .
you want all opportunities created by them to be treated with a higher priority .
it ’s now possible with new formula - based default field values .
to add a default value formula : 452 salesforce summer release notes custom field and picklist administration : new field type , field defaults , higher limits , and promotion to global picklists
so , if the user profile is fast response sales , then priority is set to high , but for everyone else it remains medium .
how is this magic possible ?
it ’s possible because now we have two levels of default values : • field - level default — defined by the formula • value - level default —
the way you used to set up default values when there ’s no formula for a default value , or when a formula does not resolve to an existing value ’s api name , the value - level default is applied .
in our example , that ’s how medium remains the default for profiles other than fast response sales .
the new formula - based default values also let you have different default values for each field that uses the same global value set .
previously , all fields had the same value , defined on a value set .
now for different default values you just set up individual default formulas for each field . see also : ideaexchange : default values on picklist fields promote your picklist fields to global value sets global picklists became generally available winter .
since then , we ’ve been busy adding features , and now you can migrate existing picklist fields into global value sets . promote a single picklist field into a global value set by editing your picklist field and clicking promote to global value set .
editions available in all editions a new global value set is created , and the promoted field now references it .
you can also use the new global value set for other fields .
there are a few limitations to be aware of : • you can only promote fields that have fewer than 1,000 values ( both active and inactive ) .
453 salesforce summer release notes permission sets : session - based permission sets generally available , permission set metadata behavior change • you can only promote restricted picklists .
if you want to promote an unrestricted picklist , first convert it to a restricted picklist . •
you can not promote a field to an existing global value set .
but check out this salesforce lab app for some help . •
after a field is promoted , you ca n’t demote it back .
global value sets get higher limits the number of entries in picklist global value sets has doubled from 500 to 1,000
. you can have up to 500 picklist global value sets in an org .
each global value set , or restricted picklist , can contain a mix of 1,000 active and inactive values .

this section : session - based permission sets are generally available session - based permission sets apply to a specific session .
use a session - based permission set to allow functional access during a predefined session type .
for example , let ’s say your org has a custom object called conference room .
a mobile app called conference room sync has read and update access to the object .
you can create a permission set to allow updates to the object only when the conference room sync connected mobile app generates the user ’s session .

but until now , you had to use code to activate a session - based permission set .

permission set metadata behavior change in api 40.0 and later , when you deploy the output of a retrieval to another org , the target org metadata is now replaced by the metadata in the deployment .

but until now , you had to use code to activate a session - based permission set .
now you can activate one easily and declaratively by using a flow .
editions activating a session - based permission set using a flow is easy .
first , when you create your permission set , select session activation required .
this selection indicates that the permissions in the permission set are available only during specified sessions .
then create a flow using the activate session - based permission set action available in the cloud flow designer .
available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions when a user runs the flow and the action fires , permissions associated with the permission set are enabled for the user . 455 salesforce
summer release notes salesforce connect : cross - org picklists , rate limit for external object search results , and temporary salesforce ids you can also deactivate the permission set by including the deactivate session - based permission set action in the flow .
important :  you can run queries , however , do not make data or object updates in flows that also activate session - based permission sets .
example :  you have a junior buyer in your org who occasionally requires access to your contracts object .
create a permission set with access to the object .
then create a flow that uses the activate session - based permission set action available in the cloud flow designer .
in the flow , pass the permission name to the action .
during runtime , the action checks who ’s running the flow .
when the junior buyer runs the flow , the activation process fires .
when the flow completes , the buyer has access to the contracts object for the current session .
permission set metadata behavior change in api 40.0 and later , when you deploy the output of a retrieval to another org , the target org metadata is now replaced by the metadata in the deployment .
in api 39.0 and earlier , when you deploy your retrieved permission set output to another org , the deployment contents are merged with your current org data .
we simplified the metadata packaging definition needed to produce consistent permission set outputs .
the consistent output lets changes be trackable in standard version control systems .
now transfers of permission set content between production , sandbox , and other related orgs is easier and more predictable .
see updated metadata types .
example :
in api version 39.0 and earlier , if your permission set contains the manage roles user permission and you deploy a metadata file without this user permission , manage roles remains enabled .
however , in api version 40.0 and later , if you deploy a metadata file without this user permission , manage roles is disabled in the target org

also , inactive picklist values on the provider org are no longer blank on external object records .
these changes apply to lightning experience , salesforce classic , and all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .
some special behaviors and limitations still apply .
• picklist and multi - select picklist fields are available only on external objects that are associated with an external data source of type salesforce connect : cross - org . •
you ca n’t edit picklist values on external objects , and changes to fields on the provider org are n’t automatically reflected in the subscriber org .
to reflect changes on the subscriber org , resync the external object , or manually delete and recreate the picklist field on the external object .
if you do n’t resync or recreate the picklist field on the external object : – when an active picklist value is added to the provider org , the subscriber org does n’t display it as an available picklist value on external object records . –
when an active picklist value is deleted from or made inactive on a restricted picklist on the provider org , the subscriber org ca n’t create or edit external object records with that value .
• global picklist value sets are n’t synced .
if a provider org ’s picklist field uses a global picklist value set , syncing creates a local picklist field on the subscriber org .
a local picklist field has its own set of values .
• inactive picklist values are n’t synced .
if the subscriber org accesses an external object record that contains an inactive picklist value , the inactive value is added to the picklist field on the external object . •
syncing converts restricted picklists on the provider org into unrestricted picklists on the subscriber org ’s external objects . •
we recommend having only unrestricted picklists on external objects , even when they ’re associated with restricted picklists on the provider org .
restricted picklists on the provider org block unapproved values from the subscriber org , eliminating the need to restrict picklists on external objects .

add yet another layer of security and protection to your wave analytics data by extending the shield platform encryption capabilities to wave data at rest .
this change applies to lightning experience , salesforce classic , and all versions of the salesforce1 mobile app .
the wave encryption at rest services are built natively into the wave platform .
the solution applies strong , probabilistic encryption on data stored at rest .
platform encryption is based on the advanced encryption standard ( aes ) with 256-bit keys using ctr mode and an initialization vector ( iv ) for every write .
all operations , including sort and group - by , work the same as without encryption , except for key management .
the data you add to the database is encrypted on the salesforce service , but archived data is not encrypted .
note :  this release contains a beta version of encryption support for wave analytics that is production quality but has known limitations .
contact salesforce to activate it .
mass encryption now includes existing email attachments when you contact salesforce for help mass - encrypting your data , we encrypt your existing data with your organization - specific data encryption key , according to your organization encryption policy .

some organizations do n't have to do anything to get this change . •
beginning with spring , view encrypted data is automatically decoupled from masking when you generate your first tenant secret . •
if you started generating tenant secrets before spring , you must activate this critical update .
the view encrypted data permission still applies to classic encryption .

we also added a field for event monitoring wave app compatibility .
editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions new fields •
login_key —
the string that ties together all events in a given user ’s login session .
it starts with a login event and ends with either a logout event or the user session expiring . •
user_id_derived —
the 18-character case - insensitive id of the person using salesforce services through the ui or the api .
renamed field •
session_id  now named session_key —
the string that ties together all events for a particular activity session .
for example , uri events while the user is interacting with an accounts page .
example :  this example is an excerpt from lightning page view event logs , which shows users’ click paths in salesforce .
to see a comprehensive view of what each user is doing in lightning experience and salesforce1 , use login_key  as an identifier across the various events and actions to tie them together .

with asynchronous soql , you can run queries in the background and retrieve results when you ’re ready .
a new field , uniquekey , is used as the primary key instead of id. you can filter asynchronous soql queries on any field instead of just eventdate  or i d  and use all operators , including comparison operators such as < = and = > . editions available in : enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions example : get
yesterday ’s last 10 successful logins select application , browser , eventdate , uniquekey , loginurl , userid from loginevent where eventdate > yesterday limit 10 and status=’success’ important :  the uniquekey  field in the loginevent object is now the unique identifier for each record .
use this field as the primary key in your queries instead of the i d  field because i d  is n’t populated in api version 40.0 and later .
also , as a result of modifications made to this release , loginevent data in your org from previous releases is n’t immediately available .
it will be available within 7 days of the summer release .

however , to reduce the impact on existing components , we adjusted the activation process .
critical updates for stricter csp restrictions stricter content security policy ( csp ) restrictions have been decoupled from lockerservice and are n't enforced in production orgs in summer .
instead , to give you more time to update your code to work with stricter csp , the stricter csp changes are available in two critical updates that affect only sandbox and developer edition orgs .
disable access to non - global apex controller methods in managed packages ( critical update ) this release includes a critical update that affects access to server - side apex controller methods from your lightning components .
if you ’ve written lightning component code that calls non - global  apex methods in a managed package , you have some work to do .
override standard actions with lightning components
at long last , you can override four of the standard actions on objects — view , new , edit , and tab — using lightning components .
you can override these actions on standard and custom objects .
overriding standard actions allows you to customize your org using lightning components , including completely customizing the way you view , create , and edit records .
lightning data service ( beta ) lightning data service is now in beta .
use lightning data service to load , create , edit , or delete a record in your component , without using apex code .
lightning data service handles sharing rules and field - level security for you .
lightning data service also improves performance and user - interface consistency .
find component markup errors faster with improved error messages we display more details for more lightning component errors .
it ’s now easier for your users to report errors they encounter , and for you to find and fix those errors .
this change affects all users , and does n’t depend on debug mode being enabled .
browser console warnings for javascript and apex actions with the same name the framework logs a browser console warning if your component has a javascript function ( client - side action ) with the same name as an apex method ( server - side action ) .
the warning is logged only in debug mode and can help in troubleshooting an otherwise hard - to - debug issue .
use the aura : valuerender event instead of a custom renderer when a component is rendered or rerendered , the aura : valuerender  event , also known as the render  event , is fired .
handle this event to perform post - processing on the dom or react to component rendering or rerendering .
the event is preferred and easier to use than the alternative of creating a custom renderer .
479 salesforce summer release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach streamlined validity checks for components if a component is invalid , cmp.get ( )  returns null .
previously , the framework returned an invalidcomponent  error .
the new behavior is more typical of standard javascript behavior and reduces framework memory usage .
use the force : hassobjectname interface with quick actions add the force : hassobjectname interface to a lightning component to enable the component to be assigned the api name of current record ’s sobject type .
the sobject name is useful if the component can be used with records of different sobject types , and needs to adapt to the specific type of the current record .
choose a csp level for lightning : container ( developer preview ) the lightning : container component allows you to upload an app developed with a third - party framework as a static resource , and host the content in a lightning component .
you can specify the content security policy ( csp ) and the landing page of your content with a json file in your static resource , giving you more fine - grained control over the security of your content .
deprecated locale parameter in auralocalizationservice javascript api methods the locale  parameter is deprecated for several methods in the auralocalizationservice  object .
the validation for the locale  parameter has also been tightened to allow locale  values to match only the user ’s language  or locale settings in salesforce .
if the locale  parameter is set to another value , it defaults to the user ’s language setting .
deprecated useappcache attribute in aura : application browser vendors have deprecated appcache , so we followed their lead .
remove the useappcache attribute in the < aura : application >  tag of your standalone apps ( .app resources ) to avoid cross - browser support issues due to deprecation by browser vendors .
if you do n’t currently set useappcache  in an < aura : application >  tag , you do n’t have to do anything because the default value of useappcache  is false .
removed lockerservice restriction on instanceof in javascript
previously , we advised against using the instanceof  operator in javascript code when lockerservice is activated .
this restriction has been removed , except when checking arrays .
new and changed lightning components we added several new components and made improvements to others so that you can create apps faster . new and changed lightning events lightning events facilitate communication between components and increase interactivity in your apps .
new and changed lightning interfaces lightning interfaces enable a component to be used in different contexts or to receive extra context data .
new javascript api methods use javascript api methods in your component ’s client - side controller , helper , or renderer .
lockerservice critical update activation lockerservice , which has been a critical update since summer ’16 , is enforced for all orgs in summer .
however , to reduce the impact on existing components , we adjusted the activation process .
lockerservice enforcement is dependent on the api version lockerservice is enforced for all lightning components created after summer ( api version 40.0 ) .
lockerservice is n’t enforced for components with api version 39.0 and lower , which covers any component created before summer .
stricter content security policy ( csp ) restrictions are n’t enforced the stricter csp restrictions , which mitigate the risk of cross - site scripting attacks , have been decoupled from lockerservice and are n’t enforced in production orgs in summer .
the stricter csp changes are available only in sandbox and developer edition orgs and can be activated in two new critical updates , one for communities and one for other contexts .
the critical updates give you more time to update your code to work with stricter csp .
480 salesforce summer release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach lockerservice features activated lockerservice enforces some security features and encourages best practices to make your code more supportable .
javascript es5 strict mode enforcement javascript es5 strict mode is implicitly enabled .
you do n’t need to specify " use strict "  in your code .
javascript strict mode makes code more robust and supportable .
for example , it throws some errors that would otherwise be suppressed .
a few common stumbling points when using strict mode are : • you must declare variables with the var keyword . •
you must explicitly attach a variable to the window  object to make the variable available outside a library . •
the libraries that your components use must also work in strict mode .
for more information about javascript strict mode , see the mozilla developer network .
dom access containment a component can only traverse the dom and access elements created by a component in the same namespace .
this behavior prevents the anti - pattern of reaching into dom elements owned by components in another namespace .
note :  it ’s an anti - pattern for any component to “ reach into ” another component , regardless of namespace .
lockerservice only prevents cross - namespace access .
your good judgment should prevent cross - component access within your own namespace as it makes components tightly coupled and more likely to break .
restrictions to global references lockerservice applies restrictions to global references .
lockerservice provides secure versions of non - intrinsic objects , such as window .
for example , the secure version of window  is securewindow .
you can interact with a secure wrapper in the same way as you interact with the non - intrinsic object , but the secure wrappers filter access to the object and its properties .
the secure wrappers expose a subset of the api of the underlying objects .
the lockerservice api viewer shows the dom apis exposed by lockerservice .
the api viewer app lists the api for securedocument , secureelement , and securewindow .
the current ui for the api viewer is unpolished .
bear with us while we improve it .
there ’s a lot of information but the main takeaway is that a background green color means that the dom method is supported .
access to supported javascript api framework methods only you can access published , supported javascript api framework methods only .
these methods are published in the reference doc app at https://<mydomain>.lightning.force.com / auradocs / reference.app , where < mydomain >  is the name of your custom salesforce domain .
previously , unsupported methods were accessible , which exposed your code to the risk of breaking when unsupported methods were changed or removed .
disabling lockerservice for a component when a component is set to at least api version 40.0 , which is the version for summer , lockerservice is enabled .
lockerservice is disabled for any component created before summer because these components have an api version less than 40.0 .
to disable lockerservice for a component , set its api version to 39.0 or lower .
component versioning enables you to associate a component with an api version .
when you create a component , the default version is the latest api version .
in developer console , click bundle version settings in the right panel to set the component version .
lockerservice is enabled for a component or an application purely based on component version .
the containment hierarchy within an application or a component does n’t factor into lockerservice enforcement .
481 salesforce summer release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach let ’s look at an example where component a contains component b.
if component a has api version 40.0 , lockerservice is enabled .
if component b has api version 39.0 , lockerservice is disabled for component b even though it ’s contained in a component , component a , that has lockerservice enabled .
for consistency and ease of debugging , we recommend that you set the same api version for all components in your app , when possible .
lockerservice setting for managed packages has been removed in spring , there was a separate setting to control whether lockerservice was enforced for components installed from a managed package .
this enable lockerservice for managed packages  setting has been removed from the lightning components page under setup .
components installed from a managed package are treated the same as any other component and are subject to lockerservice restrictions .
new appexchange security reviews and periodic re - reviews will require components to be version 40.0 or higher so that lockerservice is enabled .
the version requirement ensures that components installed from managed packages follow the security best practices that are enforced by lockerservice .
what does lockerservice affect ?
lockerservice enforces security and best practices for custom lightning components you use in : • lightning experience •
salesforce1 • lightning communities • standalone apps that you create ( for example , myapp.app ) • any other app where you can add a custom lightning component , such as salesforce console in lightning experience • lightning out lockerservice does n’t affect the following except for usage of lightning components in visualforce in these contexts : • salesforce classic • visualforce - based communities • any apps for salesforce classic , such as salesforce console in salesforce classic critical updates for stricter csp restrictions stricter content security policy ( csp ) restrictions have been decoupled from lockerservice and are n't enforced in production orgs in summer .
instead , to give you more time to update your code to work with stricter csp , the stricter csp changes are available in two critical updates that affect only sandbox and developer edition orgs .
the two critical updates —
one for communities and one for other contexts — are called : • enable
stricter content security policy for lightning components • enable stricter content security policy for lightning components in communities the lightning component framework already uses csp , which is a w3c standard , to control the source of content that can be loaded on a page .
these critical updates tighten csp to mitigate the risk of cross - site scripting attacks .
stricter csp might sound familiar to you .
in the spring lockerservice critical update , we introduced stricter csp to disallow the unsafe - inline  and unsafe - eval  keywords for inline scripts ( script - src ) .
these csp changes were enforced only in sandboxes and developer edition orgs .

disable access to non - global apex controller methods in managed packages ( critical update ) this release includes a critical update that affects access to server - side apex controller methods from your lightning components .
if you ’ve written lightning component code that calls non - global  apex methods in a managed package , you have some work to do .
as a reminder , the apex methods behind your lightning components server actions have the following access modifier requirements . • apex methods in the same namespace as your component must be marked public  or global .
• apex methods in a different namespace from your component must be marked global .
see the details , including changes you might need to make to your code , in the apex release note disable access to non - global apex controller methods in managed packages ( critical update ) .
see also : lightning components developer guide : apex server - side controller overview override standard actions with lightning components
at long last , you can override four of the standard actions on objects — view , new , edit , and tab — using lightning components .
you can override these actions on standard and custom objects .
overriding standard actions allows you to customize your org using lightning components , including completely customizing the way you view , create , and edit records .
the ability to override standard actions has long been possible using visualforce pages .
it ’s also long been a top request for lightning components .
we ’re thrilled to be adding this feature , and we hope you find it just as exciting .
( this is n’t just a feature , it ’s an adventure . )
484 salesforce summer release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach
all of that said , there ’s a lot you need to know to successfully use action overrides with lightning components .
on the surface , adding an action override that uses a lightning component is almost exactly the same as using a visualforce page .
you simply choose a different item , and away you go .
however , there are important differences from visualforce in how you create lightning components that can be used as action overrides , and significant differences in how salesforce uses them
. you ’ll want to read the details thoroughly before you get started , and test carefully in your sandbox or developer edition org before deploying to production .
standard actions and overrides basics there are six standard actions available on most standard and all custom objects : tab , list , view , edit , new , and delete .
in salesforce classic , these are all distinct actions .
lightning experience and salesforce1 combine the tab and list actions into one action , object home .
however , object home is reached via the tab action in lightning experience , and the list action in salesforce1 .
in this release , you can only override the tab action with a lightning component , so you ca n’t use a component to override the list action for salesforce1 .
finally , salesforce1 has a unique search action ( reached via tab ) , and does n’t allow you to override the new action .
( yes , it ’s a bit awkward and complicated . )
this table lists the standard actions you can override for an object as the actions are named in setup , and the resulting action that ’s overridden in the three different user experiences .
override in setup salesforce classic lightning experience saleforce1 tab list view edit new object tab object list record view record edit record create search object home record home record edit n / a object home
n / a record home record edit record create 485 salesforce summer release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach override in setup salesforce classic lightning experience saleforce1 delete record delete record delete record delete note : • “ n / a ” does n’t mean you ca n’t access the standard behavior , and it does n’t mean you ca n’t override the standard behavior .
it means you ca n’t access the override .
it ’s the override ’s functionality that ’s not available . •
there are two additional standard actions , accept and clone .
these actions are more complex , and overriding them is an advanced project . overriding them with lightning components is n’t supported .
how and where you can use lightning component action overrides lightning components can be used to override the view , new , edit , and tab standard actions in lightning experience and salesforce1 .
unlike visualforce , overrides that use lightning components do n’t affect salesforce classic .
that is : • if you override a standard action with a visualforce page , it overrides the action in salesforce classic , lightning experience , and salesforce1 . •
if you override a standard action with a lightning component , it overrides the action in lightning experience and salesforce1 , but the standard salesforce page is used in salesforce classic .
a lightning record page for an object takes precedence over an override of the object ’s view action .
that is , if you override the view action for an object , and you also create and assign a lightning record page for the object , the lightning record page is used .
the override has no effect .
this is true whether the override uses a lightning component or a visualforce page .
override a standard action with a lightning component you can override a standard action in both salesforce classic and lightning experience .
while the destination is the same , the navigation paths are different .
lightning experience 1 .
from setup , enter object  in the quick find box . 2 .
select object manager .
3 . click the name of the object for which you want to override a standard action .
4 .
select buttons , links , and actions .
salesforce classic 1 .
from setup , navigate to the object for which you want to override a standard action . •
for standard objects , navigate to build > customize , and find the object . •
for custom objects , navigate to build > create > objects , and find the object .
2 . click the name of the object .
3 .
scroll to the buttons , links , and actions section .
once you ’re viewing the object ’s buttons , links , and actions list , select edit for the action you want to override .
from here , the steps are the same . 1 .
for override with , select lightning component bundle . 2 .
from the drop - down menu , select the name of the lightning component to use as the action override .
486 salesforce summer release notes 3 .
click save .
lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach note :
users wo n’t see changes to action overrides until they reload lightning experience or salesforce1 .
creating a lightning component for use as an action override add the lightning : actionoverride  interface to a lightning component to allow it to be used as an action override in lightning experience or salesforce1 .
only components that implement this interface appear in the lightning component bundle menu of an object action override properties panel .
< aura : component implements="lightning : actionoverride , force : hasrecordid , force : hassobjectname " > < article class="slds - card " > < div class="slds - card__header slds - grid " > < header class="slds - media slds - media -- center slds - has - flexi - truncate " > < div class="slds - media__body " > < h2><span class="slds - text - heading -- small" > expense details</span></h2 > < lightning : button label="edit " onclick="{!c.handleedit}"/ > < /div
> < div class="slds - card__body">(expense details go here)</div > < /div
> < /header > < div class="slds - no - flex " > < /div > < /article >
< /aura : component > in lightning experience , the standard tab and view actions display as a page , while the standard new and edit actions display in an overlaid panel .
when used as action overrides , lightning components that implement the lightning : actionoverride interface replace the standard behavior completely .
however , overridden actions always display as a page , not as a panel .
your component displays without controls , except for the main lightning experience navigation bar .
your component is expected to provide a complete user interface for the action , including navigation or actions beyond the navigation bar .
one important difference from visualforce that ’s worth noting is how components are added to the lightning component bundle menu .
the visualforce page menu lists pages that either use the standard controller for the specific object , or that do n’t use a standard controller at all .
this filtering means that the menu options vary from object to object , and offer only pages that are specific to the object , or completely generic .
the lightning component bundle menu includes every component that implements the lightning : actionoverride interface .
a component that implements lightning : actionoverride  ca n’t restrict an admin to overriding only certain actions , or only for certain objects .
we recommend that your organization adopt processes and component naming conventions to ensure that components are used to override only the intended actions on intended objects .
even so , it ’s your responsibility as the component developer to ensure that components that implement the lightning : actionoverride  interface gracefully respond to being used with any action on any object .
487 salesforce summer release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach access current record details components you plan to use as action overrides usually need details about the object type they ’re working with , and often the id of the current record .
your component can implement the following interfaces to access those object and record details .
force : hasrecordid add the force : hasrecordid interface to a lightning component to enable the component to be assigned the id of the current record .
the current record id is useful if the component is used on a lightning record page , as an object - specific custom action or action override in lightning experience or salesforce1 , and so on .
force : hassobjectname add the force : hassobjectname interface to a lightning component to enable the component to be assigned the api name of current record ’s sobject type .
the sobject name is useful if the component can be used with records of different sobject types , and needs to adapt to the specific type of the current record .
see also : lightning components developer guide : override standard actions with lightning components lightning components developer guide : lightning : actionoverride salesforce help : activate lightning experience record pages ( can be outdated or unavailable during release preview ) lightning data service ( beta ) lightning data service is now in beta .
use lightning data service to load , create , edit , or delete a record in your component , without using apex code .
lightning data service handles sharing rules and field - level security for you .
lightning data service also improves performance and user - interface consistency .
with the move to beta , force : recordpreview  has been deprecated and replaced with force : recorddata .
if you ’re using force : recordpreview , you must refactor your components to use force : recorddata .
with force : recorddata , the targetrecord  attribute has been updated to return records in a new shape using the ui api .
see ui api developer guide : response bodies : record .
the following example shows how lookups have changed .
" lookup__c " : " 001xx000003dorbaa4 " , " lookup__r . id " : null , " lookup__r .
name " : null , " lookup__r " : { " i d " : " 001xx000003dorbaa4 " , " name " : " test " , " sobjecttype " : " account " old shape : { } } new shape : { " fields " : { " lookup__c " : { } , " lookup__r " : { " displayvalue " : " 001xx000003dorbaa4 " , " value " : " 001xx000003dorbaa4 " 488 salesforce summer release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach " displayvalue " : " test " , " value " : { " apiname " : " account " , " fields " : { " i d " : { } , " name " : { } " displayvalue " : " 001xx000003dorbaa4 " , " value " : " 001xx000003dorbaa4 " " displayvalue " : " test " , " value " : " test " } , " i d " : " 001xx000003dorbaa4 " , " recordtypeinfo " : null } } } } force : recorddata  includes a new attribute called targetfields , which is populated with a simplified view of the record ’s fields .
targetfields  is automatically updated whenever lightning data service detects a record change .
v.targetfields.name  is equivalent to v.targetrecord.fields.name.value .
a simple way to update force : recordpreview usage to force : recorddata is to change references from targetrecord to targetfields .
the following example shows the targetfields attribute within the force : recorddata component .
< force : recorddata aura : id="forcerecordcmp " recordid="{!v.recordid } " layouttype="{!v.layout } " fields="{!v.fieldstoquery } " mode="view " targetrecord="{!v.record } " targetfields="{!v.simplerecord } " targeterror="{!v.error } " / > find component markup errors faster with improved error messages we display more details for more lightning component errors .
it ’s now easier for your users to report errors they encounter , and for you to find and fix those errors .
this change affects all users , and does n’t depend on debug mode being enabled .
does this feature sound familiar ?
that ’s because we ’re expanding the improved error messages we introduced in spring .
in that release , we improved the details and presentation of some kinds of errors — specifically , server - side errors caused by incorrect component markup .
this release expands the range to include client - side javascript run - time errors .
these kinds of errors are far more common , and the lack of meaningful details sometimes made debugging harder .
expanded error panel ( summer ) error panel with limited details ( prior releases )
489 salesforce summer release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach expanded error panel ( summer ) error panel with limited details ( prior releases ) note :  the new error panel does n’t have an ok button .
to dismiss the panel , click the “ x ” in the top right .
the error panel appears only when a relevant error occurs in lightning experience or salesforce1 .
the expandable stack trace appears only on desktop and tablet form factors — not on a phone .
the improved error reporting affects only your custom components , not standard components provided with the framework .
outside of lightning experience and salesforce1 , for example , in lightning out or a standalone app , error output can include details that were previously omitted , such as a complete stack trace .
browser console warnings for javascript and apex actions with the same name the framework logs a browser console warning if your component has a javascript function ( client - side action ) with the same name as an apex method ( server - side action ) .
the warning is logged only in debug mode and can help in troubleshooting an otherwise hard - to - debug issue .
here ’s an example of the browser console warning for a c : dupactionname  component that has a javascript function and apex method with the same name , handledup : warning : component ' c : dupactionname ' has server and client action name conflicts : handledup use the aura : valuerender event instead of a custom renderer when a component is rendered or rerendered , the aura : valuerender  event , also known as the render  event , is fired .
handle this event to perform post - processing on the dom or react to component rendering or rerendering .
the event is preferred and easier to use than the alternative of creating a custom renderer .
490 salesforce summer release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach handling the aura : valuerender event is similar to handling the init  hook .
add a handler to your component 's markup .
< aura : handler name="render " value="{!this } " action="{!c.onrender}"/ > in this example , the onrender  action in your client - side controller handles initial rendering and rerendering of the component .
you can choose any name for the action  attribute .
streamlined validity checks for components if a component is invalid , cmp.get ( )  returns null .
previously , the framework returned an invalidcomponent  error .
the new behavior is more typical of standard javascript behavior and reduces framework memory usage .
if you call cmp.set ( )  on an invalid component , nothing happens and no error occurs .
it ’s essentially a no op .
the cmp.isvalid ( )  call returns false  for an invalid component .
you do n’t need a cmp.isvalid ( )  check in the callback in a client - side controller when you reference the component associated with the client - side controller .
the framework automatically checks that the component is valid .
similarly , you do n’t need a cmp.isvalid ( )  check during event handling or in a framework lifecycle hook , such as the init  event .
if you reference a component in asynchronous code , such as settimeout ( )  or setinterval ( ) , or when you use promises , a cmp.isvalid ( )  call checks that the component is still valid before processing the results of the asynchronous request .
in many scenarios , the cmp.isvalid ( )  call is n’t necessary because a null  check on a value retrieved from cmp.get ( )  is sufficient .
the main reason to call cmp.isvalid ( )  is if you ’re making multiple calls against the component and you want to avoid a null check for each result .
use the force : hassobjectname interface with quick actions add the force : hassobjectname interface to a lightning component to enable the component to be assigned the api name of current record ’s sobject type .
the sobject name is useful if the component can be used with records of different sobject types , and needs to adapt to the specific type of the current record .
previously , this interface affected only components used on lightning record pages .
now you can use it in these additional contexts .
• quick actions — components that implement the force : lightningquickaction  or force : lightningquickactionwithoutheader  interfaces .
• standard action overrides —
components that implement the lightning : actionoverride  interface .
see also : lightning components developer guide : force : hassobjectname override standard actions with lightning components choose a csp level for lightning : container ( developer preview ) the lightning : container component allows you to upload an app developed with a third - party framework as a static resource , and host the content in a lightning component .
you can specify the content security policy ( csp ) and the landing page of your content with a json file in your static resource , giving you more fine - grained control over the security of your content .
csp is an added layer of security that helps prevent certain types of attack , like cross - site scripting and data injection attacks .
a csp header specifies a policy that allows certain elements of a web page ( such as images , video , or other media ) to be loaded from a specified set of domains .
491 salesforce summer release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach specify a csp level and a landing page for your app by adding a manifest.json  file to the static resource referenced by lightning : container .
the manifest.json  file is optional , and represents a json array of pages within your app .
if you do n’t include a manifest file in your static resource , the landing page of your app must be named index.html .
this example manifest.json  includes three pages : index.html , foo.html , and bar.html . { " landing - pages " : [ { } , { } , { } , " path " : " index.html " , " content - security - policy - type " : " lightning " " path " : " foo.html " , " content - security - policy - type " : " minimum " " path " : " bar.html " , " content - security - policy - type " : " custom " " content - security - policy " : " default - src * ; " ] } each page in your app can have a csp level of lightning , minimum , or custom . see also : lightning components developer guide : lightning container ( developer preview ) deprecated locale parameter in auralocalizationservice javascript api methods the locale  parameter is deprecated for several methods in the auralocalizationservice  object .
the validation for the locale  parameter has also been tightened to allow locale  values to match only the user ’s language  or locale  settings in salesforce .
if the locale  parameter is set to another value , it defaults to the user ’s language setting .
the locale  parameter has been deprecated for these auralocalizationservice  methods : • formatdate •
formatdatetime • formatdatetimeutc • formatdateutc • formattime • formattimeutc • parsedatetime • parsedatetimeutc
for related locale  changes in several date and time components , see new and changed lightning components .
492 salesforce summer release notes lightning components : security , developer productivity , and app reach deprecated useappcache attribute in aura : application browser vendors have deprecated appcache , so we followed their lead .
remove the useappcache attribute in the < aura : application >  tag of your standalone apps ( .app resources ) to avoid cross - browser support issues due to deprecation by browser vendors .
if you do n’t currently set useappcache  in an < aura : application >  tag , you do n’t have to do anything because the default value of useappcache  is false .
note :  we included this information in a patch release for the spring release notes .
we ’re repeating the deprecation notice in case you missed the patch update .
removed lockerservice restriction on instanceof in javascript
previously , we advised against using the instanceof  operator in javascript code when lockerservice is activated .
this restriction has been removed , except when checking arrays .
except when checking arrays , feel free to use instanceof  in your components or upload static resources for third - party libraries that use instanceof  in their internals .
to check if a given object is an array , use array.isarray(objtotest )  instead of instanceof .
lockerservice uses the standard javascript proxy  object .
proxy  does n’t support using instanceof with a native array .
new and changed lightning components we added several new components and made improvements to others so that you can create apps faster . new components the following components are new .

use advanced pdf to render visualforce pages as pdf files ( pilot ) advanced pdf renders visualforce pages as pdf files with broader support for modern html standards , such as css3 , javascript , and html5 .
this change applies to both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
note :  we provide advanced pdf to selected customers through a pilot program that requires agreement to specific terms and conditions .
to be nominated to participate in the program , contact salesforce .
pilot programs are subject to change , and we ca n’t guarantee acceptance .
advanced pdf is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
we ca n’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all .
make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available products and features .
to use advanced pdf , set renderas="advanced_pdf "  in the < apex : page >  tag of a visualforce page with api version 40.0 or later .
this process is similar to the existing process for rendering a visualforce page as a standard pdf file .
503 salesforce summer release notes visualforce : access to page metrics and improved security pdf pages rendered with advanced pdf are subject to the same limitations as legacy pdf pages , including the maximum page size and limited number of fetched resources .
advanced pdf pages also time out after rendering for 2 minutes , which includes asynchronous processing time .
preview your pages because advanced pdf is built on chromium , it ’s easy to preview your visualforce pages in google chrome .
to preview a page , from chrome , select file > print .
preserve background colors and images because the rendered pdf is optimized for printed pages , by default it does not preserve background colors and images .
to preserve background colors and images , add a line to your page ’s css .
@media print { -webkit - print - color - adjust : exact ; } customize the pdf output advanced pdf supports the css paged media specification .
use these standards to set the paper size , margins , and other attributes .
to learn more about css paged media , see the w3c ’s website .

errors during saving that are caused by field access limitations do not display error messages .
access visualforce page metrics using the soap api to query metrics on the visualforce pages in your org , use the visualforceaccessmetrics  object in the salesforce soap api .
this change applies to both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
make a soql query in workbench to get information from the visualforceaccessmetrics  object .
this is a sample soql call .
select apexpageid , dailypageviewcount , id , metricsdate from visualforceaccessmetrics each visualforceaccessmetrics  object tracks the daily page view count in the dailypageviewcount  field .
the date the metrics were collected is specified in metricsdate , and the id of the tracked visualforce page is specified in apexpageid .
page views are tallied the day after the page is viewed , and each visualforceaccessmetrics  object is removed after 90 days .
using visualforceaccessmetrics , you can track the number of views each visualforce page in your org receives in a 24-hour time period .
to find out how many views a page got over the course of multiple days , you can query multiple visualforceaccessmetrics objects for the same apexpageid .
504 salesforce summer release notes visualforce : access to page metrics and improved security roll back changes in your org when remote javascript methods throw exceptions when a javascript method in an apex class calling a remote action throws an exception , the action is n’t completed .

allow csrf protection on get requests to visualforce pages critical update postponed this critical update , released in spring , was scheduled for auto - activation in summer , but has been postponed to october 15 , 2017 .
this critical update gives you the option of ensuring that visualforce pages receive a csrf token with a get request .
while creating a visualforce page in setup , you can select require csrf protection on get requests .
this option gives your visualforce page an extra layer of security that guards against cross - site request forgery ( csrf ) .
previously , this option only had an effect when applied to visualforce pages used for delete action overrides .
although you can enable csrf protection on any visualforce page , this critical update does not enable protection on every page .
when this option is enabled for a visualforce page , you ca n’t access that page by entering its url—/apex / pagename — and plain links to that page using < a >  tags do n’t work .
plain links from a page with csrf checks work , but links to the page do not .
for example , if your page has the name pagename , the link < a href=" / apex / pagename" > link</a >  does n’t work .
instead , use the urlfor ( )  formula function , the $ page global variable , or the apex : outputlink  component .
< apex : outputlink value=" / apex / pagename" > link using apex : outputlink</apex : outputlink > < a href="{!$page .
pagename}" > link using $ page</a > < a href="{!urlfor($page .
pagename)}" > link using urlfor()</a > csrf checks on get requests also affect how visualforce pages are referenced from apex controllers .
methods that return the url of csrf - protected pages for the purpose of navigation do n’t work : public string getpage ( ) { return ' /apex / pagename ' ; } } instead , use methods that return a reference to the visualforce page instead of the url directly .
public class customcontroller { public pagereference getpage ( ) { return new pagereference('/apex / pagename ' ) ; public pagereference getpage1 ( ) { return page .
pagename ; } } when you use one of these methods to link to a page , visualforce adds the required csrf token to the url .
these are the preferred methods for linking to visualforce pages , regardless of whether csrf protection is enabled for the page .
these are the only methods available for adding a csrf token to a url for a visualforce page .
505 salesforce summer release notes apex code : improved performance and security test this critical update this update will be enabled everywhere on the auto - activation date .
we recommend that you test your visualforce code in a developer edition org before and verify that links to all your visualforce pages using csrf protection still work .
if you must work in your production org , do so during off - peak hours .
to activate this critical update : 1 .
from setup , enter critical updates  in the quick find  box , and then select critical updates .
2 . click activate for allow csrf protection on get requests to visualforce pages .
3 . test links to visualforce pages that have csrf protection on get requests enabled .
add clickjack protection for legacy browsers to visualforce pages without page header is now enforced ( critical update ) clickjack protection for legacy browsers was a critical update in winter and was enforced for all orgs on february 10 , 2017 .
this critical update extends legacy browser - compatible clickjack protection for visualforce pages that set showheader="false "  and are configured to use api versions 26.0 or earlier .
several security settings add clickjack protection to visualforce pages .
this critical update affects two of these settings .
the enable clickjack protection for customer visualforce pages with headers disabled setting , located in security > session settings in setup , enables clickjack protection on an org ’s visualforce pages that set the page ’s showheader  attribute to false .
the clickjack protection level setting , located in develop > sites in setup , enables clickjack protection for visualforce pages displayed in force.com sites .
modern browsers are protected from clickjacking by setting the x - frame - options http header .
legacy browsers , such as older versions of internet explorer , do n’t respect this header .
to enable clickjack protection for older browsers , some html markup and javascript code are added to the page itself .
however , when rendered without the standard salesforce page header ( by setting the page ’s showheader  attribute to false ) , visualforce pages set to api version 26.0 or earlier do n’t include the html markup and javascript code necessary to embed the clickjack protection scripts for legacy browsers .
legacy browser clickjack protection was omitted even when the org or site was configured to include the protection .
with this update enabled , visualforce ensures that , when necessary , the expected markup and code are added to the page regardless of the page ’s api setting .
this update allows all visualforce pages to respect the org or site ’s clickjack protection settings .
this critical update has no effect on pages that set the page ’s contenttype  attribute to any value besides “ text / html ” or “ text / xhtml ”

update metadata that your app uses internally without exposing these types and components to your users . •
creating custom configuration tools — use metadata in apex to provide custom tools for admins to customize apps and packages .
metadata access in apex is currently limited to custom metadata records and page layouts .
you can retrieve , create , or update custom metadata , but you can not delete metadata through apex .
for more information and examples of how to deploy and retrieve metadata in apex , see the metadata feature documentation and metadata  namespace reference documentation in the apex developer guide see also : idea exchange : ability to update metadata from apex ( apex metadata api ) send and manage orders with apex if you ’re a salesforce partner , use the new channel order apex api to automate order submission and management .
after you send orders to salesforce , you can edit , recall , or clone them using methods in the provided apex classes .
the channel order apex api replaces the legacy partner order submit api .
note :  this feature is available to eligible salesforce partners .

see also : automate order processing with the channel order apex api modifying an apex class invalidates platform cache cache misses can occur when platform cache is invalidated .
a new circumstance that invalidates some or all platform cache is modifying an apex class .
you can directly or indirectly modify an apex class in a few ways .
• editing the apex class from setup or the developer console • installing or upgrading a package , which modifies an apex class • deploying metadata using the metadata api , which modifies an apex class to ensure that your apex code handles cache misses , follow platform cache best practices or use the new cache .
cachebuilder interface .
see also : apex developer guide : safely cache values with the cachebuilder interface apex developer guide : platform cache best practices safely cache values with the new cache builder interface the cache .
cachebuilder interface makes it easy to safely store and retrieve values to a session or org cache .
a platform cache best practice is to ensure that your code handles cache misses by testing cache requests that return null .
you can write this code yourself , or you can use the new cache .
cachebuilder  interface . 508 salesforce summer release notes apex code : improved performance and security rather than declaring what you want to cache in your apex class , create an inner class that implements the cachebuilder  interface .
the interface has a single method , doload(var ) .
when you override doload(var ) , you code the logic that builds the cached value based on its argument .
but you do n’t call this method directly .
instead , salesforce calls it indirectly the first time you reference the class that you created that implements cachebuilder .
subsequent calls get the value from the cache as long as the value exists .
if the value does n’t exist , the doload(var )  method is called again to build the value .
let ’s look at an example .
suppose you have an apex class in which you often run a soql query to look up a user record based on a user id .
soql queries can be expensive , and salesforce user records do n’t typically change much , so the user information is a good candidate for cachebuilder .
the userinfocache  class implements cachebuilder  and puts the soql query inside the doload(var )  method with the user id as its parameter .
class userinfocache implements cache .
cachebuilder { public object doload(string userid ) { user u = ( user)[select i d , isactive , username from user where i d = : userid ] ; return u ; } } this example shows how to get the user record from the org cache .
user batman = ( user ) cache .
org.get(userinfocache.class , ‘ 00541000000ek4c ' ) ; when you run the get ( )  method , salesforce searches the cache using a unique key that consists of the strings 00541000000ek4c and userinfocache  ( the class that implements cachebuilder ) .
if salesforce finds a cached value , it returns it .
following our example , the cached value is a user record associated with the id 00541000000ek4c .
if salesforce does n’t find a value , it executes the doload(var )  method of userinfocache again ( and reruns the soql query ) , caches the user record , and then returns it .
for more information and examples , see the platform cache feature documentation and cache  namespace reference documentation in the apex developer guide see also : apex developer guide : safely cache values with the cachebuilder interface cache operations supported in visualforce controllers cache operations made using the put and remove methods in the cache namespace are now supported in constructors and getter methods of visualforce controllers .

when this update is enabled , only methods marked with the global  access modifier are accessible by lightning components from outside the package namespace .
these access controls prevent you from using unsupported api methods that the package author did n’t intend for global access .
when added to a managed package , only apex controller methods marked global  should be accessible by lightning components outside of that managed package ’s namespace .
methods marked public  in their apex definitions should be accessible only to lightning components included in the package ’s same namespace .
when this update is enabled , these rules are enforced .
prior to this update , non - global  methods ( that is , apex controller methods that were n’t marked with the global  access modifier ) could be accessed by lightning components outside of the package namespace .
when this update is enabled , if you ’ve written code that incorrectly depends on non - global  apex methods in a managed package , server actions that call those methods fail .
update your code to use only the supported api methods provided by the package as global methods .

connectapi ( chatter in apex ) : new and changed classes and enums create custom experiences in salesforce using chatter in apex .
in this release , we introduce read and unread feed elements and enhance direct messages , moderation , and streams .
many chatter rest api resource actions are exposed as static methods on apex classes in the connectapi  namespace .
these methods use other connectapi  classes to input and return information .
the connectapi  namespace is referred to as chatter in apex .
in apex , it ’s possible to access some chatter data using soql queries and objects .
however , connectapi  classes expose chatter data in a much simpler way .
data is localized and structured for display .
for example , instead of making many calls to access and assemble a feed , you can do it with a single call .
note :  to integrate mobile apps , intranet sites , and third - party web applications with chatter and communities , use chatter rest api .

whatever you want to be notified about , salesforce ’s enterprise messaging platform provides the delivery of secure and scalable custom notifications within salesforce and from external sources .
this change applies to both lightning experience and salesforce classic .
platform events are part of salesforce ’s enterprise messaging platform .
the platform provides an event - driven messaging architecture to enable apps to communicate inside and outside of salesforce .
custom data in your events are stored in custom fields that you define .
platform events simplify the process of communicating changes and responding to them without writing complex logic .
publishers and subscribers communicate with each other through events .
multiple subscribers can listen to the same event and carry out different actions .
by using platform events , publishers can send customized event data through apex or an api .
subscribers can receive custom notifications from salesforce or an external system using apex or cometd clients .
based on the event ’s contents , subscribers can process custom business logic , such as sending an email or logging a case .
for example , a software system monitoring a printer can make an api call to publish an event when the ink is low .
the printer event can contain custom fields for the printer model , serial number , and ink level .
the event is processed in salesforce by an apex trigger that places an order for a new cartridge .
define your platform event define your platform event on the platform events page in the salesforce user interface .
from setup , enter platform events  in the quick find box , then select platform events .
create a platform event definition by giving it a name and adding custom fields .
the custom fields define the data that is sent in the event messages .
platform events support a subset of field types in salesforce .
for example , this table lists a definition of custom fields for a printer ink event .
field name printer model serial number ink percentage field api name printer_model__c serial_number__c ink_percentage__c manufacturing date manufacturing_date__c field type text text number date a platform event is a special kind of sobject .
an event notification is an instance of the platform event , similar to how a record is an instance of a custom object .
unlike custom objects , you ca n’t view event records in the salesforce user interface , and platform events do n’t have page layouts .
platform events are n’t transactional and ca n’t be rolled back .
also , platform events are retained for 24 hours and cometd subscribers can retrieve past events using a unique id ( the replayid field value ) . 548 salesforce summer release notes api : new objects and types , search enhancements , and ui api platform event limits description performance and unlimited editions enterprise edition all other supported editions maximum number of events published per hour ( events can be published using apex or apis . )

the add - on license increases your daily limit of delivered events by 100,000 more events .
for example , for unlimited edition , the add - on license increases the daily limit of delivered events from 50,000 to 150,000 events .
platform event changes in summer
in the last release , platform events was in beta .
in this release , it is generally available , and we made the following improvements and changes .
non - transactional events platform events are processed outside database transactions in the force.com platform .
as a result , they ca n’t be rolled back .
limits we made various limit changes , including the addition of an add - on license for increased event limits for cometd clients .
see platform event limits .

enhancements to bigobjects ( pilot ) bigobjects now support packaging , full delete lifecycles , partial metadata edits , long text area datatypes , bulk api queries , and the use of in ( ) clauses in soql .
packaging support bigobjects can be included in the full lifecycle of a managed or unmanaged package .
bigobjects can be added to existing packages or included in new packages .
packages are automatically updated with bigobject fields and indexes .
packages make it easier to distribute your bigobjects to other users and orgs .
full delete lifecycle bigobjects support the full entity delete lifecycle via the setup ui .
deleted bigobjects are soft deleted , meaning there is a 15-day period where they can be recovered or permanently erased .
after 15 days , the bigobject is automatically permanently deleted .
to restore a bigobject , change the deployment status and set the required flag for any non - index fields as necessary .
fields in the index will automatically be reset to required .
partial metadata edit bigobject names , labels , descriptions , deployed status , and field requiredness for non - index fields can be edited via the setup ui .
bigobject field names and labels can also be edited with the setup ui .
long text area support long text has been added as a valid datatype for bigobjects , allowing bigobjects to store even more kinds of data , like copies of entire standard objects .
long text fields for bigobjects follow the same limits as custom objects .
bulk api query support standard synchronous soql can be used to query bigobjects via bulk api .
synchronous soql query limitations still apply , and there are limits to the number of records that can be queried in a single bulk query call . in ( )
clause for soql synchronous soql supports the use of a single in ( ) clause to query bigobject data using multiple criteria .
the in ( ) clause is only supported in synchronous soql .

granular permissions async soql no longer requires the “
modify all data ” permission when running queries .
to run queries , “
read ” can be set on the source objects and “ create / update ” can be set on the target objects on a per - object basis .
the appropriate field permissions are still required .
field substitution in targetvaluemap any field or alias can be used as the targetvaluemap value in the select clause of a query .
targetvaluemap can be used to include descriptive text or to concatenate multiple fields as the target external id for upsert operations .

relationships are connections between records .
use relationships to display data about related object records on a record ’s detail page .
the child relationship response body contains these properties : property name type description childobjectapiname string fieldname string junctionidlistnames string [ ] junctionreferenceto string [ ] the api name of the child object that contains the reference to the parent object .
the field on the child object that contains the reference to the parent object .
instead of defining relationships through primary keys and foreign keys , the salesforce database uses relationship fields .
a relationship field is a custom field that stores the id of the related parent record .
a collection of fields of the type junctionidlist .
a junctionidlist  is a string array of referenced id values that represent the many - to - many relationship of an underlying junction entity .
each id in a junctionidlist  is a polymorphic key , which is an id that can refer to more than one type of object .

new objects and types , search enhancements , and ui api lightning console javascript api ( pilot ) the lightning console javascript api provides javascript methods so that developers can programmatically control tabs , subtabs , and the utility bar in lightning console apps .
this feature is new in lightning experience .
note : the lightning console javascript api is available as a developer preview .
the lightning console javascript api is n’t generally available unless or until salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements .
we ca n’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all .
all commands , parameters , and other features are subject to change or deprecation at any time , with or without notice
. do n’t implement functionality developed with these commands or tools .
we also provide the lightning console javascript api to selected customers through a pilot program that requires agreement to specific terms and conditions .
to be nominated to participate in the program , contact salesforce .
pilot programs are subject to change , and we ca n’t guarantee acceptance .
make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available products and features .
you can provide feedback and suggestions for the lightning console javascript api in the ideaexchange .
this api brings the benefits of the console integration toolkit , which works only in salesforce classic , to lightning experience and integrates with lightning components used in lightning console apps and the utility bar .
editions available in : lightning experience available in : professional , enterprise , performance , unlimited , and developer editions lightning console apps are available for an extra cost to users with salesforce platform user licenses for certain products .
some restrictions apply .
for pricing details , contact your salesforce account executive .
the lightning console javascript api has two libraries , the workspace api and the utility bar api .
to use the libraries , include force : workspaceapiaccess  or force : utilitybarapiaccess  in your lightning component , respectively .
these components allow you to use api methods in the javascript controller of your component .
this lightning component uses the workspace api to open a new tab .
< aura : component implements="flexipage : availableforallpagetypes " access="global " > < force : workspaceapiaccess aura : id="workspace " / > < lightning : button label="open tab " onclick= " { ! c.opentab } " / > < /aura : component > this is the component ’s controller .
( { opentab : function(component ) { var workspaceapi = component.find("workspace " ) ; workspaceapi.opentab ( { urlorrecordid : ' # /sobject/001r0000003hgssiac / view ' , focus : true , } ) ; } , } ) when this component is added to a lightning page used in a console app or utility bar , clicking the button will open a new tab with the specified relative url .
this is what the component looks like as part of a case detail page in a lightning console app .
